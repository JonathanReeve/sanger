		<p>Christmas--1939! In the world about us international tragedy makes a mockery of the
			peace, the harmony, and the good will that are associated with the season. Yet as long
			as the fires of faith and brotherhood and love burn brighter in countless homes at
			Christmas-tide, there is hope for a saner civilization ultimately. For society basically
			is the family unit, gigantically multiplied. And so those of us deeply concerned with
			the necessity for strengthening family life and family security through family planning
			may draw strength and inspiration from the knowledge that our efforts are reflected not
			only in family welfare, but also help to lay the ground work for the mass thinking that
			must ultimately be applied to the family of nations. An intelligent adjustment of
			national needs to national resources cannot forever be ignored if we are to see the
			light of peace and prosperity shine again throughout the world. </p>
