		<head>FIGHTS TO TEACH BIRTH CONTROL</head>
		<div>
			<dateline>
				<place reg="New York, NY">New York,</place>, <date value="1916-01-10">Jan. 10</date>--
			</dateline>
			<p>
				<q who="CDT">The trial of Mrs. Margaret H. Sanger will begin Tuesday in the federal
					building before Federal <person reg="Clayton, Henry DeLamar">Judge
						Clayton</person>, where she will be called upon to answer the charges of
					disseminating literature advocating birth control. Mrs. Sanger has refused to
					have any counsel, despite the advice of her friends, and is going to plead her
					own case.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="CDT">At a dinner Monday at the <org>Hotel Brevoort</org>, at which will be
					present a number of her friends, Mrs. Sanger expects to explain what her case
					will be in the trial. At her home at 26 Post avenue Mrs. Sanger gave a history
					of the case and told what she intends to do.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Poor Families Largest.</head>
			<p>"I found out," <q who="CDT">she said,</q> "in my nursing experience so many facts
				about the overcrowding of children and the condition of the mother and the children
				that I thought something should be done. Only poor women were having large families,
				and the rich women who could give their children more comfort were not having
				children.</p>
			<p>"I studied abroad and came back with my mind made up to give to the <place>United
					States</place> the benefit of my experience. I found that nowhere in this
				country were there any facts relative to the social problems as applied to large
				families or population.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Her Publication Suppressed.</head>
			<p>"I was astonished at this and it was then that I began to publish the <title
					type="journal">Woman Rebel</title> to call attention to the conditions, and
				addressed to the working women of America. The publication seemed innocuous to me,
				but the postal authorities suppressed the first edition and seven editions out of
				nine were suppressed and confiscated because they discussed the most innocent side
				of the subject.</p>
			<p>"My question was whether working women can afford to keep large families and whether
				they are willing to hear discussion on the subject. I was not allowed to give the
				message to the working women. I insisted then and now that a discussion of this was
				right and fitting and the subject should be brought up.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Would Change the Law.</head>
			<p>"If, as charged, my discussion of the subject comes under <name type="law"
					reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">section 211</name> of the
				obscenity law, then that section should be done away with.</p>
			<p>"I believe sincerely that the double standard of morals for men and women is due
				primarily to ignorance of birth control. Men are afraid of having large families;
				therefore, they do not feel that they can marry young and have children. The result
				is that they do not marry and the result is much of the immorality of today.</p>
			<p>"I expect to conduct my own defense in my trial. I do not intend to make a high flown
				and oratorical defense, and I do not see why I should go to the big expense of
				having a lawyer. It will be a simple speech, for to me it is a simple subject, so I
				will try to take the place of an attorney. I think--I feel sure--that I will be
				acquitted, and it will be the greatest victory to the freedom of the press since the
				days of our forefathers."</p>

		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Many Don't Know How.</head>
			<p>
				<q who="CDT">Mrs. <person reg="Stokes, Rose Pastor">Rose Pastor Stokes,</person> a
					member of the dinner committee, said to a reporter:</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="STORO">"The question has interested me very much. Every one knows that well
					to do people are breaking the law regarding birth control all the time, and the
					legislatures themselves join in that. They cannot understand that everybody does
					not know how to control and restrict birth. An overwhelming majority of people
					cannot get the knowledge.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="STORO">"We see the result in ever increasing numbers of children, most of
					whom die. By the time the ones who die have been buried, with the consequent
					expense, nothing is left for the others to live on, and they are starved and
					miserable. I think that birth control would regulate and end this."</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">"A Grave Social Problem."</head>
			<q who="CDT">
				<p>Miss <person reg="Carpenter, Alice">Alice Carpenter,</person> who is also a
					member of the dinner committee, said:</p>
			</q>
			<p>
				<q who="CARAL">"I am on the side of Mrs. Sanger because I believe the problem of
					birth control to be one of the grave social problems of our day. In my own
					personal experience I have found many poor families who are struggling to give
					their children a better education than they themselves have had and are
					handicapped by the fact that there are too many mouths to feed."</q>
