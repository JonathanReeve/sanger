		<p>Friends of the Radio: I want to talk to the mothers of <place>Massachusetts</place> this
			evening about family planning. By this I do not mean the planning you already do
			preparing the food, clothing and comforts in your household. I mean family planning
			which include the spacing of births and the regulation of the number of children to the
			family income.</p>
		<p> Every normal woman wants children. When she does not want them she should wait until she
			does; but there is a vast difference between a woman’s desire to have two, three or four
			children that she can adequately take care of, and the dread of having a large family of
			ten or twelve, knowing she cannot provide for their education or welfare.</p>
		<p> Scientific knowledge of birth control will help her. Remember that birth control means
			to <emph rend="underlined">prevent</emph> , <emph rend="underlined">not to
				destroy</emph>. It does not mean to interfere with life after it has begun. This is
			not necessary.</p>
		<p> “Prevention is better than cure” is an old adage rightly applied in family planning.
			Every mother should have knowledge to help her do this. The father should have a right
			to say <emph rend="underlined">how many</emph> he can support and the mother should say
			when they should be born. But first, every mother has a right to consider <emph
				rend="underlined">her own health</emph> and the <emph rend="underlined">health of
				her children</emph> in arranging for the number of children she plans to have.
			Again, they must be made in consideration of the husband’s earning powers and of the
			standards of living that the parents wish to maintain. If the father’s wages remain the
			same and babies continue to arrive year after year, the father soon gets discouraged,
			what with bills for nurses, hospitals, x-rays, specialists, for adenoid and tonsil
			operations, dentists and numerous other bills for the mother and the children, the
			father soon feels the burden which falls too heavily upon his already bent shoulders,
			even when he is fortunate enough to have an average paying job.</p>
		<p> There are also other conditions both physical and economic where parents should postpone
			the arrival of the baby until these conditions are changed. <emph rend="underlined"
				>1st</emph> and <emph rend="underlined">most important</emph> is; wherever there is
			transmissible disease which affects either the man or the woman, such as insanity,
			feeble-mindedness, epilepsy or venereal diseases. It is unfair to children to be born of
			parents where these diseases can be passed on to the unborn child. 2nd. <emph
				rend="underlined">The second</emph> condition is where the mother has tuberculosis
			or a disease of the heart or kidneys. Her health is directly affected when pregnancy
			takes place, and women often die of these diseases because of the complications which
			pregnancy causes. She should recover from these ailments <emph rend="underlined"
				>before</emph> she brings a child into the world.</p>
		<p> 3rd. The third is, that even a healthy mother should plan to space the births of
			children from two to three years, in order to regain her strength and vitality and plan
			to prepare for the birth of the next child that she may wish to have; and <emph
				rend="underlined">4th</emph> the fourth is the economic factor. Every sensible man
			or woman knows the hardships endured by children when they are born into grinding
			poverty. Millions of parents are at present married and anxious about the welfare of
			their living children. 11,000,000 people are still unemployed; 4,000,000 families are
			depending on public relief for a mere existence. It is not fair to the children, born or
			unborn, or to these mothers, to keep from parents scientific information which would
			enable them to prevent the coming of more children until those conditions are
			bettered.</p>
		<p> Federal laws were passed by <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> 62 years
			ago. These laws have operated to keep poor mothers of this country in absolute ignorance
			of such knowledge. We are fighting to change these laws. We want hospitals, clinics,
			public health agencies and members of the medical profession to help parents obtain
			clean, harmless, safe and reliable birth control information to enable them to have only
			the number of children they want and can bring up as a credit to the parents and the
			Nation.</p>
		<p> These obsolete Federal laws have worked a <emph rend="underlined">tremendous</emph>
			hardship on the motherhood of this nation. It is the poorest mother who has paid the
			penalty of ignorance. She has paid for her ignorance in ill health; in infant mortality,
			in maternal mortality, she has paid for it in over-crowding in slums, in unemployment
			and in child labor. Mothers have paid the price by living in constant fear and anxiety;
			fear of the coming of another child that could not be fed or cared for on the husband’s
			wage. It is this army of mothers who are now on relief. They have paid and are still
			paying the price of ignorance of birth control. These are the forgotten women. They are
			too poor to have influence with Congressman, they are too weak to rebel against their
			own conditions and they cry out for us to help.</p>
		<p> A few weeks ago a young mother came to me. She was only 21 years old. She was already
			the mother of five children, the youngest baby just three months. Her husband hadn’t had
			any work for two years. She did all her own housework and weighed only 90 pounds. They
			tried to live on five dollars a week, but what she wanted most was to be able to keep
			her family together and information by which she would not have to have more. Hers was a
			tragic pathetic case and there are millions like her.</p>
		<p> The nation is paying for this ignorance in human misery and the spread of social and
			transmissible diseases, it is paying for it in the general lowering of the standards of
			living, paying for it in out differential birth rate, in national unemployment. We are
			paying for it in ever <emph rend="underlined">mounting taxes</emph> and a <emph
				rend="underlined">condition of chaos</emph> which threatens to undermine our
			economic, social and cultural institutions upon which our civilization has been founded.
			Our population has increased 22,000,000 since 1920 and we continue to increase over 1
			and 1/2 millions a year.</p>
		<p> If you are in sympathy with the work I am doing, help me change our laws of
			Massachusetts, write to me in care of Station WEEI. We have petitions that we wish to
			present to the <person reg="Roosevelt, Franklin Delano">President of the United
				States</person>. We are asking him to help the mothers of the nation to free
			themselves from the hardships of enslaved maternity. Help the mothers of this nation to
			help themselves through the knowledge of birth control. </p>
