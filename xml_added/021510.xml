        <head>REPLY TO THE VIEWS OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE OF THE UNITED LUTHERAN CHURCH TO BE
            PRESENTED AT THE CONVENTION FOR 1926 IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, by Margaret Sanger.</head>
        <p>When one reads the twelve views to be offered by the Committee, one is at a loss to know
            how such inconsistent thinking can permeate so important a subject as marriage and its
            sanctity.</p>
        <p>It is less than a year ago that the <org>National Lutheran Council</org> labeled a
            resolution condemning the practice of Birth Control because it was recognized by the
            majority of the Council that the practice of Birth Control is considered an economic
            rather than a moral issue. What has happened to make a change of front, Birth Control is
            still an economic issue. It is a health issue. It presses more and more upon the
            economic conscience of the community.</p>
        <p>The United Lutheran Church surely is strong enough to stand upon its own feet and not
            need to echo the views of other Church bodies. I believe that the members of the
            Lutheran Church will oppose such inconsistency as offered by the Committee when the
            assertion is made that the chief aim of married life is the birth of children. This is
            dogma, pure and simple. With ninety-nine people out of a hundred the birth of children
            is the result and not the aim of marriage. That the limitation of birth by artificial
            means is anti-Christian is a matter of opinion. There are many good Lutherans who
            disagree with this point. In fact, I should like to take a poll of the number of
            children born to the Lutheran Committee, and I believe I would verify my belief that
            such a statement is hypocritical.</p>
        <p>The attitude taken <q>The pastors so consent to marry only the innocent party of a
                divorce</q> is ludicrous. Like many other well-intentioned designs, it will drive
            people from the church and in many cases seek relations outside of marrige. The ban of
            Birth Contril will be futile. It will be far better for the Committee in its aim to
            recognize that marriage is one of the most important problems of the home. To study
            these problems and to face the facts squarely that the greatest immediate problem of the
            home is to have unwatned children.</p>
        <p>The Church would do a great service to bring scientific instruction to the poor,
            diseased, defective members in the Community, such as is already obtainable to the
            well-to-do and the intelligent parishoners of the Church.</p>
