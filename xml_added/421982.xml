		<head>Catholic Leaders Called Short-Sighted on Birth Control</head>
		<byline>By Tomi Kaizawa</byline>
		<p><q who="HSB">Margaret Sanger, birth control crusader, today accused the</q> "powers that
			be" <q who="HSB">of the Catholic Church of</q> "short-sighted, political not religious
			thinking" <q who="HSB">regarding planning parenthood.</q></p>
		<p><q who="HSB">She asserted in an interview in her <org>Reef Hotel</org> penthouse suite
				that "the <org reg="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</org> is the only one
				against us. All the other churches are definitely in favor of our program.</q></p>
		<p>"The Catholics' reasons are politically, not religiously, motivated."</p>
		<p>"And members of the church are expected to follow blindly."</p>
		<p>"But not all of them do," <q who="HSB">she asserted and claimed there are</q> "just as
			many Catholic women subscribing to birth control methods as there are women outside the
			church."</p>
		<p><q who="HSB">She noted </q>"mothers--Catholic or otherwise--are all the same. They want
			to be healthy and have healthy children. Fathers, too, are all the same. They want their
			wives alive and healthy."</p>
		<p><q who="HSB">She said it is widely used in the <place reg="United States">U.S.</place> today with</q> "very few side
			effects. Occasionally I have heard of a woman getting a headache from it."</p>
		<p>"Like all contraceptives, the pill is 100 per cent effective if it's used, not forgotten
			on the shelf,"<q who="HSB"> she stated.</q></p>
		<p><q who="HSB">Mrs. Sanger, who has been championing the cause of birth control for over 40
				of her 70-plus years, sees the need for more research in getting an even easier
				contraceptive.</q></p>
		<p><q who="HSB">Mrs. Sanger said her interest in birth control was sparked when as a nurse
				she was</q> "in touch with all the misery unplanned parenthood brought." </p>
		<p>"The problem is most pressing in the <place reg="Asia">Orient</place>" <q who="HSB">she
				said, noting that results are</q> "very encouraging. The governments take a big
			interest in the matter. <place>India</place>, for instance, has allotted $10 million
			toward the program."</p>
