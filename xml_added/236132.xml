		<head rend="underline">Chicago Address to Women.</head>
		<p>We are regimented by conventions. Habits and customs control us. We are ever afraid of
			the untried, of the unknown. Instead of making of life a wide expanse of social
			development we allow ourselves to be herded into narrow tracks through fear of
			conventions. We are the victims of habit, not only of action but of thought. Our parents
			thought so and so; and we think so and so. The world expects us to do so and so, and so
			and so we do.</p>
		<p>The earth is a globe, it revolves around the sun, it rotates on its axis: its inhabitants
			have learned <emph rend="underline">this</emph> much in spite of opposition. And the
			whole HISTORY of Civilization is the history of the STRUGGLE between those obeying the
			OLD laws and those establishing the NEW.</p>
		<p>
			<add rend="underline">And</add> Every age adopts that which was considered UTOPIAN in
			the last and wonders how its forefathers could have been so blind, backward, stupid,
				<add>for</add> Progress infuses itself into everything and woe to him who would
			impede its course. </p>
		<p><person reg="Bruno, Giordano">Bruno</person> was burned to death because he chose to
			teach the Italian people scientific truths about religion in the Italian language
			instead of using the dead languages which had been employed to cloak the REAL EMPTINESS
			of its dogmas.</p>
		<p><person rend="underline" reg="Socrates (Greek)">Socrates</person> was poisoned because he dared to combat the
			SUPERSTITIONS of his people. Not long after his death, the citizens of <place
				reg="Athens, Greece">Athens</place>, his countrymen, recognized the INJUSTICE of his
			sentence, and executed <emph rend="underline">his</emph> accuser. Socrates thereby
			became a demi-god.</p>
		<p><person>Jesus Christ</person> was crucified because he attempted to SUPERCEDE the ritual
			of <person reg="Moses (Biblical)">Moses</person>. As time rolled on the opinions of men CHANGED until
			Christianity became an established dogma which it meant DEATH to dispute. Though he who
			does dispute it may be imprisoned, slandered and persecuted, if he has courage in his
			belief future ages may exalt HIM to a divinity and PERSECUTE others in his name as he
			was persecuted in the name of his predecessor. SUCH is the HOMAGE of the world.</p>
		<p>Now we realize that Christianity <del>came but to LAY</del>
			<add>has come &amp; has lain</add> CHAINS on the human mind, and <del>to</del>
			<add>has</add> imposed upon mankind the weary struggle to RECOVER the freedoms it had
			obtained.</p>
		<p><add>Christianity turned the hands of Civilization back 1000 years it turned them back
				2000 years for woman and</add> Today we find ourselves engaged in a relentless
			struggle with the SAME POWERS OF OPPRESSION which wrought from us the liberties our
			forefathers obtained <emph rend="underline">for</emph> and gave to us for
			preservation.</p>
		<p>Today we are engaged in a GREAT STRUGGLE FOR WOMAN'S LIBERTY,! for the freedom of HER OWN
			BODY, for her RELEASE from the domination and control, of CHURCH AND STATE.</p>
		<p>Birth Control is the first step toward the goal of <del>her</del><add>this</add> freedom.
			She can never gain political, social or spiritual freedom so long as her body remains
			THE SLAVE OF IGNORANCE. No woman <add>can</add>call herself free who cannot choose the
			time to be a mother or not as she sees fit. And women of today REBEL against spending
			the whole of their adult lives in bringing children into the world. Out of this
			rebellion, out of this impulse, out of this desire <add>for voluntary motherhood</add>
			has risen the Birth Control movement in the United States.</p>
		<p> I believe that this is the <del><emph rend="underline">first</emph> great movement since
				the Civil War,<add>most revolutionary movement of the day</add> and THE MOST
				IMPORTANT ISSUE of the Twentieth Century. Its advocates <add>too</add> have been
				SLANDERED, PERSECUTED, JAILED because they have voiced THE CRY OF WORKING WOMAN for
					<del>their</del>
				<add>her</add> BODILY FREEDOM.</del>
		</p>
		<p>In nearly every country in the world today the great mass of educated and wealthy women
			PRACTICE SOME METHOD OF BIRTH CONTROL, though in the same countries the WORKING WOMEN
			are kept in ignorance of this knowledge.</p>
		<p>It is said by physicians and others who work among the working women, that as soon as she
			rises out of the lowest stages of ignorance and poverty her FIRST STEP is to seek
			information of some practical means to <del>limit her family</del>
			<add>control the size of her family</add>.</p>
		<p>Everywhere she seeks for knowledge on the subject very seldom can she find it, because
			the medical profession refuses to give it to her and others with whom she comes in daily
			contact are as ignorant as herself of the subject.</p>
		<p>The consequence is she must accept <add>any</add> stray bits of information wholly
			UNRELIABLE and UNINFORMED. The result is that quacks and abortionists thrive on her
				<emph rend="underline">innocence</emph> and ignorance is perpetuated.</p>

		<p>In my opinion the proper authorities to give <add>special &amp; scientific</add> advice
			on Birth Control are the DOCTORS and NURSES <add>&amp; midwives-</add>. No other class
			of men or women are so AWARE of the NEED of this knowledge among the working people as
			they. YET THEY HAVE REMAINED SILENT! The time has come when they MUST TAKE THEIR STAND
			in their progressive movement. For though the subject is largely <emph rend="underline"
				>social</emph> and <emph rend="underline">economic</emph> yet it is in the main
				<emph rend="underline">physical</emph> and <emph rend="underline">medical</emph>,
			and the object of those advancing the cause is to open the doors of the medical
			profession, who in turn will force open the doors of the laboratories, where our
			chemists will give the women of the twentieth century reliable and scientific means of
			contraception hitherto unknown.</p>
		<p> A meeting of this kind is somewhat new, but undeniably important. It may be
			DISAPPOINTING to some of you to hear that I am NOT going to give you information to
			prevent conception in this meeting. <add>I take for granted that every woman in this
				audience -- is serious minded &amp; wishes to learn some thing about the sacred
				truths of her body sex functions. It is not the best place to give knowledge.</add>
		</p>
		<p>You have a LAW in <place reg="Illinois">this State</place> which FORBIDS your getting
			this information <add>about abortions</add>. <del>from me NOW</del> but it does <emph
				rend="underline">ALLOW</emph> your PHYSICIAN to instruct you <add>in prevention of
				conception</add>. </p>
		<p>I do not intend to VIOLATE this LAW, nor to IMPOSE any legal defense of my cause upon
			your consideration, <emph rend="underline">UNLESS YOU WOMEN OF CHICAGO desire me to do
				so</emph>.! I do intend however to give you special information concerning your
			bodies which Every <add>adult</add>Women Should Know and which it is well within
				<del>your RIGHTS</del> for you to hear. <add>my <gap reason="illegible"/> rights to
				tell you</add>. </p>
		<p>The FIRST subject which we shall take up is:</p>

		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"><emph rend="underline">HOW CONCEPTION TAKES PLACE</emph>.!</head>
			<p>It is important that every adult man and woman should know and clearly understand
				what CONCEPTION means and how <add>it</add> occurs.</p>
			<p>WHEN ONCE THIS IS THOROUGHLY KNOWN IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO <emph rend="underline"
					>CONFUSE</emph> BIRTH CONTROL WITH ABORTION as the <add>ignorant</add> opponents
				of this movement are so fond of doing.</p>
			<p>I regret that I shall have time only to go very briefly into the subject to give you
				a general idea of what actually occurs.</p>
			<p>In every woman's <add>body there are two</add> ovaries <add>and within them</add>
				there are embedded millions of ovules or eggs. They are present in every female at
				birth, and as</p>
			<p><gap extent="one page" reason="missing"/>fertilized ovum any attempt at removing it
				or preventing its development or further growth is called ABORTION. <add>B.C. is not
					abortion!</add></p>
			<p>That there is almost no other country in the world where so many abortions occur as
				in the <place>United States</place> is a fact worthy of consideration and interest.
				That the laws in these same United States are the most rigid and the penalty the
				heaviest for any action toward abolishing abortion (by prevention of conception) of
				any country is also worthy of interest.</p>
			<p>Abortion is the most common as well as one of the most SERIOUS disturbances of
				pregnancy yet it is said that ONE out of EVERY FIVE pregnancies terminate abruptly
				in abortion.</p>
			<p>It is roughly estimated that at least <emph rend="underline">250,000</emph> abortions
				occur in the United States EACH YEAR while <emph rend="underline">50,000</emph>
				women die from their effects.</p>
			<p><del>There</del>
				<add>One of the most tragic facts today </add>
				<del>no doubt</del>is that <add>our</add> women are apt to look upon an abortion as
				of little consequence and to treat it <del>accordingly</del>
				<add>lightly</add>. An abortion should be regarded as IMPORTANT <add>serious</add> a
				matter as a confinement and REQUIRES AS MUCH ATTENTION as the birth of a child at
				full term.</p>
			<p>It is only the women of wealth who can afford to give an abortion the proper care and
				treatment both at the same time and afterwards. Consequently THESE WOMEN seldom
				suffer any serious consequences from its occurrence.</p>
			<p>It is the WORKING WOMEN, whose means are limited <add>cheapest men incompetent</add>
				and who must continue AT WORK before they have recovered from the effects of an
				abortion, who are the GREAT ARMY OF SUFFERERS and it is from among THESE WOMEN that
				the DEATHS due to abortions usually ensue.</p>
			<p>If women had the knowledge to prevent conception there would be almost NO NECESSITY
				for abortion.!! It is because abortions occurring so frequently among the working
				women today -- the suffering, illness and death resulting from the carelessness of
				their performance, -- that has urged me to make ANY SACRIFICE and direct my efforts
				to make it possible for these women to obtain: CLEAN, HARMLESS KNOWLEDGE OF THE
				MEANS TO PREVENT CONCEPTION and thereby PREVENT ABORTIONS and <emph rend="underline"
					>the NECESSITY FOR THEM</emph>!</p>
			<p>During my nursing experience in <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> I came in
				contact with some of the midwives and had occasion to view their appliances which
				they use in their profession. I was HORRIFIED at the filthy condition of the
				scissors, forceps, brushes, etc. their kit contained.</p>
			<p>IS IT ANY WONDER THAT DEATHS OF THE POORER WOMEN MOUNT SO HIGH?</p>
			<p>The more I see of women who have had abortions and the more I see of the RESULTS of
				abortions, the more convinced I am of their INJURIOUS effect on women and the
				stronger do I urge the knowledge of the prevention of conception.</p>
			<p>The results of abortion are usually of far more serious effect on the woman's health
				than a full term child birth. There is the possibility of the womb not returning to
				its natural size but remaining large and heavy and tending to fall away from its
				proper position in the body.</p>
			<p>Then one abortion so often leaves the uterus in a condition to conceive very easily
				again, and unless prevention is strictly followed another pregnancy will SURELY
				occur. Frequent abortions have a tendency to establish sterility or barrenness in
				the woman as well as result in pelvic ailments.</p>
			<p>There are many cases of women suffering from tuberculosis, kidney disease, heart
				disease, pelvic deformities, etc. to whom pregnancy stimulates the disease and often
				means death, so that the physician must perform an abortion in order that her health
				and life may be preserved. THERE IS NO LAW AGAINST THE PHYSICIAN'S DOING THIS, yet
				our laws <add>must state</add>
				<del>make</del> it a CRIME for that physician to inform that same woman how to
				prevent conception and thereby prevent abortion and its tragic suffering.</p>
			<p>
				<emph rend="underline"> KNOWLEDGE TO PREVENT CONCEPTION IS THE ONLY CURE FOR
					ABORTION.</emph>
			</p>
			<p>May the women of this country rise up and demand the REPEAL of the laws which force
				such abhorrent conditions upon them <add>&amp; demand this knowledge to prevent
					abortion.</add></p>
			<p>Naturally one of the first questions asked by all concerned is:</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">
				<emph rend="underline">ARE PREVENTIVE MEASURES CERTAIN?</emph>
			</head>
			<p>It is always difficult to say that ANYTHING is CERTAIN in its result. A surgeon would
				not succeed with the most serious operation was he not most particular to take every
				precaution and insist that all directions be faithfully carried out.</p>
			<p>IT IS THE SAME WITH PREVENTION. There is EVERY REASON to believe that if the
				directions are carefully followed in preventive methods some means are quite
				certain.</p>
			<p>The educated women have been practicing methods of prevention for nearly a
				half-century and have found them certain and safe. Of course -- if a woman is TOO
				INDOLENT or TOO INDIFFERENT to <add>(douche)</add>to take precautions and to give
				herself certain attentions in cleanliness and hygiene, then NOTHING can be certain,
				but I have found most women desirous and anxious <emph rend="underline">for
					knowledge</emph>, no matter what inconvenience it implied.</p>
			<p><del>One</del>
				<add>Another</add> of the questions so often asked by women who are fearful to use
				preventatives is:</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">
				<emph rend="underline">ARE PREVENTIVE METHODS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH?</emph>
			</head>
			<p>A <person reg="Unknown">very prominent authority</person> claims that there is far
				more injury to a woman's health <emph rend="underline">to live in CONSTANT
					FEAR</emph> of pregnancy than the use of all the preventive measures in the
				world. It is further claimed by some physicians that some preventive is absolutely
				necessary and even helpful to a nervously weak woman in helping her to regain her
				health. But much depends upon THE KIND of method used.</p>
			<p>Strong solutions of anti-septics for the douche are one of the many injurious
				methods. When they are ABOVE THEIR PROPER STRENGTH they are liable to injure the
				delicate membranes of the parts. The same solutions in weaker proportions <add><emph
						rend="underline">bichloride tablets in bag. salt</emph></add>act as a
				cleanser and are seldom injurious. <add>but as</add> Every woman is susceptible to a
				greater or lesser degree to all drugs, <del>and</del>
				<add>it is best</add> if possible a physician should advise the use of them.</p>
			<p>There are also certain mechanical methods <add>buttons etc wishbone pessaries</add>
				employed by some women which might give rise to an irritation and cause disease, but
				the temporary use of the same would be quite harmless.</p>
			<p>In employing any preventive measure there is almost NO DANGER TO THE MAN'S HEALTH at
				all. Even the habit of coitus-interruptus which is so commonly practiced everywhere
				is not considered as dangerous to his health as was formerly thought, but on the
				other hand is considered by many prominent authorities as injurious to the woman's
				nervous system. In fact it is considered the cause of many nervous disturbances in
				women. <add>(explain)</add></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">DO PREVENTIVE METHODS LEAD TO STERILITY?</head>
			<p>This question is often asked by women early in marriage, who desire to use preventive
				methods for a period, until it becomes economically possible to care for a
					<del>child</del>
				<add>family</add>. It is feared that the use of preventives will cause sterility,
				and when a child is desired the woman will be unable to conceive.</p>
			<p><add>Physicians agree that</add> There is no ground for this fear. It has been shown
				by hundreds of cases where parents have lost a child, that though they had practiced
				prevention for four, five, or even ten years, conception has taken place when
				desired. Personally, I know a patient who gave birth to a child after 20 years' use
				of preventives.</p>
			<p>As mentioned before, strong solutions should be especially avoided in this respect.
				But it is well to get the advice of your family physician and bring these questions
				before him. <add>It all depends upon the proper method used.</add></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">IS THERE A SAFE PERIOD?</head>
			<p>There are some women who believe there is a safe period in the month when CONCEPTION
					<del>does</del>
				<add>can</add> NOT take place. That if intercourse does not occur from four days
				before menstruation until a week after it has ceased, in the time remaining
				conception will not occur.</p>
			<p>There are many women who have found this to be true in their own experience, but most
				medical authorities DENY its infallibility, and personally I have known of more
				abortions resulting from this method that those with whom it has been successful. IT
				IS NOT WISE TO TRUST TO IT.</p>
			<p>There are also many women, and a few men, who claim that intercourse is intended only
				for procreation, and that it should not take place unless a child is desired. In
				this way no preventives are necessary.</p>
			<p>I must admit I that held this view for years, and I have a <del>lingering regard
					for</del>
				<add>interest in</add> it still. I believe the sexual act involves a CREATIVE ENERGY
				which can be directed into channels for creative work and self-expression.</p>
			<p>I lay special stress on CREATIVE WORK, which in my estimation draws on different
				forces in the body than mechanical, physical or routine labor.</p>
			<p>But I know, too, that the sexual life of man differs greatly in nature and the course
				of its development from the sexual activity of woman, and also that the MAJORITY of
				men and women today are doing VERY LITTLE creative work, which leaves almost the
				only outlet for their creative energy through the sexual act.</p>
			<p>The consequence is, all modern life FORCES a sexual outlet through intercourse, and
				IT IS ONLY THE FEW EXCEPTIONS who are able to live up to this theory, even if it is
				accepted.</p>
			<p>When once we throw down the bars of Puritanical bigotry and look upon sex and its
				expression apart from procreation as a fundamental basis of all life, we shall come
				to realize that all the repressive measures employed by legislatures and laws cannot
				solve our sex problem. Let us rather BEAUTIFY them and direct their flow into
				creative channels for the benefit of society, and look upon sex as <person
					reg="Emerson, Ralph Waldo">Emerson</person> did when he said: "<q who="EMERA"
					>Work your passions into poetry</q>".</p>
			<p>A new world awaits humanity when women shall raise the standard of sex and raise man
				to its level, of <emph rend="underline">beauty</emph> and <emph rend="underline"
					>significance</emph> and <emph rend="underline">recognize</emph> and <emph
					rend="underline">accept</emph> and <emph rend="underline">understand</emph> it,
				instead of suppressing and denying <del>it</del>
				<add>&amp; debasing it</add>.</p>

			<head type="sub">WHEN SHOULD WOMEN AVOID HAVING CHILDREN?</head>
			<p>It is well for a woman not to give birth to a child:<list>

			<p>Some of those who take their stand against Birth Control do so by the thought that we
				have no right to destroy potential life.</p>
			<p>A little study of human and animal physiology would convince them that every celibate
				male and female as well as married men insistently and inevitably waste MYRIADS of
				germ cells which had the potentiality of fusion with an ovum and consequently
				produced a child had the opportunity been given them.<add> If it's a crime to
					prevent creation then its a crime to refuse to marry a man--</add></p>
			<p>For the supposed sake of one or two of these myriad sperms <add>cells</add> which
				must NATURALLY and INEVITABLY die <add>any way</add> they
					<del>encourage</del><add>insist upon</add> the production of babies in rapid
				succession, which are weakened by their proximity which might otherwise have been
				sturdy and healthy, had they been conceived further apart from each other.</p>
			<p>Such people, while awake to the claims of the unborn and even the unconceived,
				continue to be BLIND to the claims of the woman's health and will force a woman to
				BEAR and BRING FORTH a child ANNUALLY. When each child following so rapidly its
				predecessor saps and exhausts the vital strength which is available for the making
				of the offspring which lowers the vitality of each child and EVENTUALLY MURDERS THE
				WOMAN who bears them.</p>
			<p>Dr. <person reg="Ploetz, Alfred">Ploetz</person> found that the death rate of the
				FIRST BORN infants is 220 a thousand.</p>
			<p>The death rate of the SEVENTH is 330 a thousand. While that of the TWELFTH is 600 a
				thousand. So that when "Nature has its way" and twelve children come to sap a
				woman's vitality so little strength has she left that nearly 60 percent of these
				later ones die.</p>
			<p>WE FIND THAT EVEN <emph rend="underline">NATURE</emph> TENDS TOWARD BIRTH
				CONTROL!!</p>
			<p>But what a hideous waste of vitality! What a hideous orgy of agony. For mothers to
				produce in anguish, DEATH-DOOMED and SUFFERING INFANTS.</p>
			<p>To those who protest that we have no right to interfere with THE COURSE OF NATURE one
				must point out that the whole of CIVILIZATION, <emph rend="underline">EVERYTHING
					THAT SEPARATES MAN FROM ANIMALS</emph>, is an INTERFERENCE with what people
				commonly call NATURE.</p>
			<p>Railroads, boats, bridges, walking upright, living in houses, <add>shaving</add>,
				wearing clothes, cooking and talking all in the beginning were AGAINST Nature. We
				have come to realize that all civilization means the CONTROL and DIRECTION of
				Nature.</p>
			<p>Actions differ in their relative positions in the scale of things. ONLY THOSE ACTIONS
				ARE WORTHY WHICH LEAD THE RACE ONWARD TO A HIGHER AND FULLER COMPLETION AND TO THE
				PERFECTING OF ITS POWERS, <del>which</del> steer the race into the main current of
				that stream of life and <del>vitality</del> which courses through us and impels us
				forward.</p>
			<p>We <add>who advocate Birth Control</add> are trying to raise the STANDARD and
				HEIGHTEN the sacredness of human life, promote the well-being and happiness of
					<del>the hopeless</del>
				<add>humanity</add>
				<del>and</del>
				<add>we are</add> trying to <add>intelligently</add> solve some of the MOST

				<del>high</del>, <add>far higher,</add> and GLORIFIED <add>privilege</add>
				<del>womanhood</del>.</p>
