			<p>Forgotten Man-- Today we witness the stirring among the masses toward male solidarity
				emancipation as this country has not seen since its discovery.</p>
			<p> But is it not time some voice should be raised in behalf of the FORGOTTEN WOMAN--that
				a New Deal should be made for those forty-three million (43,000,000) women of
				child-bearing age, whose life’s happiness and development depends absolutely upon
				knowledge to control that function?</p>
			<p> A New Deal for the Mother immortalized in Poetry, but cruelly neglected in fact--the
				Mother whose life is shadowed by the constant fears of pregnancy but whose appeal
				for knowledge is denied.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Prostitution can not be fought by laws or espionage. Without birth control
				prostitution can not be fought with success.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Hordes of human beings hurled into existence through self-indulgence, accident, or
				casual ignorance. This power of parenthood--with divine potentialities--has been
				diverted from its course into cruel and ruthless exploitation.</p>
			<p> The benefits of birth control are direct and indirect.</p>
			<p> The indirect effects are specially though not exclusively concerned with its action
				of stabilizing the growth of population. The political Economist, the Sociologist
				are concerned.</p>
			<p> The Physician, Social worker, Parents and Individuals are interested in its direct
				influence. <list>

					<item>2 The Family</item>
					<item> 3 The Race</item>
				</list></p>
			<p> We must bring home to the minds of thinking people the vital significance of the
				hereditary factor in each individual life. As we see the truth we must have the
				courage to proclaim it. It is a stirring and encouraging fact that within the past
				twenty years, knowledge of birth control has been demanded by all groups of people;
				that the truth shall no longer be concealed; that the facts of life shall be faced
				with unswerving courage; and that ignorance and prejudice shall no longer be allowed
				to menace the lives and happiness of the whole of one people. Many outposts have
				been captured. The citadel of opposition must be overcome with the weapons of fact,
				persuasion, and of unconquerable truth, for truth is greater than half-truth, as
				knowledge is nobler than ignorance.</p>
			<p> Wholesale human misery can and will be prevented when we apply the certainty of
				modern science to our problems instead of the baseless superstitions of medieval
				theology.</p>
			<p> If we shall take a broad outlook of the present Social and Economic problems, we
				must see that:</p>
			<p>
				<emph rend="underlined">First</emph>--Habits, customs and tradition of a large part
				of our population are distinctly dysgenic, owing mainly to centuries of erroneous
				and false ideas.</p>
			<p>
				<emph rend="underlined">Second</emph>--That to continue the rate of growth of
				population is the most momentous issue before the nations of the world today. It
				transcends all mere political controversy such as tariffs, taxes, currency which can
				be dealt with by Congresses and Legislatures. But the real life of a Nation, the
				life of the years ahead depends upon the application of the science of life to the
				basic problem of the quality of life itself.</p>
			<p> We have come to the Crossroads. Which path shall we choose--Strength and Efficiency
				or Degeneration and Decay?</p>
			<p> Birth Control and National Strength must stand or fall together. No longer can we
				build on the fertility of the physically and mentally unfit. Their upkeep and
				maintenance has already created a burden under which the Nation begins to stagger.
				Billions of dollars each year has been spent to preserve them with all the ingenious
				and kindly resources that modern humanitarian instinct could command.</p>
			<p> We have allowed and encouraged the procreation and multiplication of the physically
				and mentally and socially unfit and preserved them at the cost of the skilled and
				professional classes until the balance has become unequal to the task.</p>
			<p> A Nation rises or sinks on the physical or mental quality of its citizens. It cannot
				thrive when its fundamental structure is based on defective stock, the increase of
				morons, feebleminded, psychopaths, diseased slum populations.</p>
			<p> It is the mentally weak, the dull, who sap the vitality of the Nation. Their
				increase becomes a menace to all legislative or social progress. They become the
				hordes of unemployables, easily exploitable, too weak and ill-equipped to earn a
				livelihood unaided. They continue to use up the energy and resources of life,
				without contributing anything to advance our civilization.</p>
			<p> We cannot separate the basic quality of life from the economic and fundamental
				wealth of our Nation. The two are interlocked and react upon each other in the
				closest fashion. Only our politicians and self-seeking opportunists fail to
				recognize this. It is not necessary to speak with detailed precision on the minor
				variations of statistical result. The actual insane may be one million instead of
				two. The mentally defective may be 35 million instead of 50 million. The
				unemployables. The unemployables, sick, diseased, may be more or less than our
				statistics quote, but the fact remains clear, and, all honest investigators will
				admit, that one-fourth of those who make up this Nation are physically or mentally
				unfit to carry on the heritage of our civilization. It is this group who combat and
				weigh down the advance of the Nation. A Nation can only survive in this inter
				struggle when its units are each fit to carry its equal share.</p>
			<p> Had birth control been applied to the problems of poverty, maternal and infant
				welfare, overcrowding, delinquency and dependency twenty years ago, many of the
				social and economic conditions we are faced with today would not have arisen. It is
				the stubborn opposition of medical superstitions which hold progress back. It is the
				opponents of this humane cause who have increased human misery and at whose doors
				the death of women in child-bearing and abortions should be laid. They take their
				stand against birth control but in doing so they must recognize and admit that they
				also stand for unnecessary and inexcusable waste of mothers’ lives the crowding out
				of child life, the stunting and dwarfing of child development; the conditions of
				overcrowding; the increase of abortions; in armies of unemployed and
				unemployables.</p>
			<p> The increasing hordes of feeble-minded children, mental defectives, insane parents
				and physical and mental weaklings--they have put forth no program to deal with these
				fundamental factors of life.</p>
			<p> Future generations will look upon their ignorance and arrogance as enemies of the
				poor, who while living in comfort themselves exploit the fears and superstitions of
				the poverty stricken masses for their own power and wealth</p>
			<p>
				<person reg="Ellis, Havelock">Havelock Ellis</person> says:</p>
			<p> "<q who="ELLHA">Birth control beyond all reasonable doubt, is, with the feelings and
					ideas at present prevailing in our civilization, the only method we possess of
					effecting that restriction of the population, which is required in order to make
					human life on earth fairly livable.</q>"</p>
			<p> The birth control movement spread and is now everywhere accepted by the enlightened
				and intelligent of all nations in practice if not in principle.</p>
			<p> To this fact comes the complaint that birth control is practiced among the best
				class of the country. Well, why not? A beneficial and progressive measure must be
				applied where initiative and capability exist. It need not end there. Laws compel
				the poor to apply for medical knowledge to public institutions.</p>
			<p>
				<person reg="Dickinson, Robert Latou">Dickinson</person> and <person
					reg="Bryant, Louise Stevens">Bryant</person> “<q>all birth control is self
					control.</q>” "<q who="DICRO"> and <q who="BRYLO"/>The final justification for
					the practice of birth control is, that in it we possess what may now be the only
					instrument left us for moulding the future race.</q>” </p>
			<p> The history of the Woman’s Movement in this era, when it shall be written, will
				record a strange and illogical fact which will be difficult for future generations
				to believe or even to understand. The fact that the Woman’s Movement for
				emancipation has kept itself apart from any cause which advocated sex reform, sex
				hygiene and birth control.</p>
			<p> It will be unbelievable for any enlightened forward thinking person to understand
				this because it is just that difference in sex--the biological burden or function of
				child bearing and rearing which rests so definitely on her that has caused less
				efficiency in woman and consequently her unequal economic position in Society.</p>
			<p> Woman has struggled upward for her rights and she has won them one by one, but until
				she has her biological freedom over the laws of child-bearing her other prizes so
				hardly won can do little for her onward march in civilization. The function of
				procreation must be under her control for the woman who is constantly submerged in
				the fears of pregnancy can never be qual in social or political efficiency to
				men.</p>
			<p> Were it not for the few women who through wealth and the position of influence or or
				those living childless or unmarried lives, the Woman’s Movement would still be
				struggling for her equal place in the social strata.</p>
			<p> Are there any women today anywhere in political, commercial or professional
				leadership with large families? No. It is only because they have had this function
				under complete control that they have been able to rise to any heights in
				educational cultural stature of our modern life.</p>
			<p> The leading women in the political movement while accepting the practice of birth
				control for themselves have been most punctilious in keeping their news and opinions
				on this subject cloistered with those which their ecclesiastical fathers handed down
				to them. They left the work of refuting certain claims about sex and sin, and shame
				to <emph rend="underlined">men</emph>. It was such writers as <person
					reg="Carpenter, Edward">Edward Carpenter</person>, Havelock Ellis, <person
					reg="Forel, August">August Forel</person> and others equally courageous, who
				dared to awaken and arouse public interest in the beauty, power and magnitude of the
				sex impulse and to dissociate it from indecency, obscenity and pornography. The
				younger people today are accepting these views which are forging ahead with other
				advanced ideas. They all link together in a chain giving strength to a higher phase
				of consciousness by which the human race will advance and evolve. </p>
