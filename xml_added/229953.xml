		<p>Madam chairman, and ladies and gentlemen: I am glad to join with Mrs. <person
				reg="Hooker, Edith Houghton">Hooker</person> in her welcome of you here today. I
			cannot tell you what this conference means to me. I cannot tell you with what enthusiasm
			we have all been inspired by the results of the letters and the answers that we have had
			while we have been getting up this conference. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate
			the assistance and help of all those of you who are here, and the thousands of others
			who have written us and encouraged us to go ahead with this great work and at this
			particular time.</p>
		<p>The idea in calling together this conference was to bring together not our old friends
			and advocates who have been putting the idea of birth control forward for the last few
			years, but the idea has been rather to bring to us new people, new ideas, of those who
			have been working in social agencies, those who have been working in other groups for
			the same result, namely, a better nation, a better people in our nation.</p>
		<p>And so we rejoice to have you here who are representing other social activities, health
			agencies, and we have thought and we hope that you will give us new ideas, as we hope
			that you will listen attentively to what is being read here, and that you will also be
			inspired by some thing to help you further your own work and your own cause.</p>
		<p>We are today confronted in the <place>United States</place> with various problems. One of
			the serious problems is that the fit and healthy members of our community are carrying
			the burden of the unfit members of the community. Everywhere we look we see that poverty
			and large families go hand in hand. Everywhere we look we see that we for the past
			quarter of a century have been putting the energy and the efforts of our healthy and fit
			elements into bricks and mortar. We have been building up environment while we have paid
			very little attention to the quality of human life. We have erected palatial residences
			for the unfit, for the insane, for the feeble-minded, and for those who should not be
			born, to say nothing of being able to carry on the next generation. We are confronted
			with this problem and everywhere we see that the sentiment of our people has developed
			far beyond human intelligence.</p>
		<p>We are in a condition of society today, not only here but practically in every country in
			the world, where the masses of the unfit have propagated to such an extent that our
			intelligence is not able to grasp the conditions or to cope with the conditions which
			this has created. Now the time has come when we must all join together in stopping at
			its course, misery, ignorance, delinquency and crime.</p>
		<p>And that is the program of the birth control platform. That is what the birth control
			movement intends to do, to stop at its source these qualities which are making for a
			weakened and a deteriorated race.</p>
		<p>There have been two instincts which have ever guided mankind in its destiny. Those
			instincts are hunger and sex. The instinct of hunger has received consideration in
			practically every civilized country and man has adapted his institutions to meet these
			needs. But the instinct of sex has been ignored. Now I claim, and most of us who make a
			study of this subject know, that this instinct is just as deep, is just as fundamental a
			thing as the instinct of hunger. It cannot be crushed. It cannot be ignored. It cannot
			be denied, not can it be thwarted by denying it. But we must understand it. We must
			recognize it, and we must in recognizing and studying it, we will then utilize it as we
			utilize music and prayer for our higher powers and for a higher illumination.
			(applause)</p>
		<p>The question that confronts us is, is it desirable that man shall control this instinct.
			Is it desirable that this instinct may be satisfied without increasing the population of
			the world? Is mankind to be benefitted by obtaining control over this instinct? And is
			it desirable that in satisfying it we shall say whether offspring shall be the result of
			this or not. The question we will try to answer today is, is it desirable to obtain
			control over this instinct? Is it desirable that the unhealthy, the unfit, the feeble
			members of the community shall propagate their kind and fill the world with their
			offspring? Is it right for these to populate the world, as has been done, or shall some
			stringent war measure be taken to stop this if we are to survive. After discussing the
			desirability of these questions, the next question to be discussed will be the
			possibility of bringing this about.</p>
		<p>We all know that knowledge is power. Man has a right to all knowledge. Ignorance is not a
			virtue, nor is it a safeguard against immorality. If there is knowledge which enables
			man to control birth, or to control conception, then it is only right on principle that
			he should have all knowledge, and he should be able to obtain that result.</p>
		<p>The proceedings of this conference will be to discuss these two subjects. We must first
			establish the principle of the right of birth control. We must encourage this principle
			to be accepted by other agencies and to have this placed into the programs of other
			agencies for peace, for social betterment, and for a better world.</p>
		<p>The idea of birth control is not new. It has been advocated almost from the very earliest
			history of man. We know that <person reg="Plato (Greek)">Plato</person> and <person reg="Aristotle (Greek)">Aristotle</person>
			advocated it. It has been advocated by practically all the greatest philosophers and
			thinkers of all times. But the idea in the past of limiting their numbers was a little
			different from that of today. The method which was employed to limit numbers in the past
			has been infanticide, abortion, mainly, while today it is preventing conception. This
			new idea is now making headway in practically every country in the world. The birth
			control movement as it stands in the United States has been the greatest instrument for
			circulating this idea, this modern scientific idea in every country in the world. So far
			we have groups in <place>China</place>, in <place>India</place>, in
			<place>Japan</place>, in <place>Mexico</place>, in <place>South America</place>, to say
			nothing of groups in <place>Germany</place>, <place>England</place>, <place
				reg="Scandinavia">Scandinavian countries</place>, <place>Italy</place>,
				<place>Russia</place> and <place>Hungary</place>. This new idea is taking its place
			in the social body, in the constructive platform of all of these countries, and I think
			for that we can say that America has been the leading country in this new idea of birth
			control. (applause)</p>
		<p>This is the first birth control conference ever held in this country, and we have a very
			elaborate platform, and our aims, as we understand them, are based upon scientific
			principles. We intend to organize the thinking populations of this country. We intend to
			have our groups, active groups, in every city in this country. We know, most of us, that
			where people have privately believed in birth control and have agreed with us on the
			side, yet they have not had the courage to come out and speak in public or to work for
			this principle, and the time has come when this must be changed. The time has come when
			we must make the intelligent members of our community come forth and work with us and
			join with us in making this a national program. We want to have the restrictive laws,
			both federal and state, repealed, and we stand very definitely--our group--that doctors
			should give this information. We stand very definitely on that principle, that this
			question of giving information is not a question of free speech, but it is a question of
			scientific, technical knowledge. (applause) We want the medical profession to give to
			women the most scientific data obtainable. It was only a few years ago, you know, that
			obstetrics was considered good enough for any woman to take care of. A woman who had to
			have a child was allowed to have her neighbor come in to deliver her. The medical
			profession did not consider that that was dignified enough for them to look after. And
			now the same thing has been considered of contraception, and we are going to make this
			function of the control of birth a scientific one. We are going to put it into the
			dignified role of science and that is where it belongs.</p>
		<p>Our aim is definitely to repeal these laws so that the medical profession may give to
			women at their request knowledge to prevent conception. We believe that with intelligent
			guidance and with the assistance of the intelligent members of our community we can
			bring this about in a very short time, but we need your help. We need your courage. We
			need you to come out and stand with us on our platform. We also want your guidance, and
			your assistance, and your suggestions. There is not any of us that think we know it all.
			We know that you in your special lines have experience by which we can benefit and we
			want your cooperation. In other words, we want to join together to make this country the
			greatest country in the world. We want to make this a country where its inhabitants and
			every member of the community is an independent, self-reliant, courageous individual who
			will take their place in this nation, and this nation in its turn will take its place
			among the forward nations of the civilized world. (applause)</p>
