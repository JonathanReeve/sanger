		<head>MRS. SANGER WAS GLAD SHE WAS INDICTED</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="NYTR">A prima donna on a farewell tour could have justifiably envied the
					enthusiastic reception given Mrs. Margaret Sanger at the <org>Bandbox
						Theatre</org> last evening.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYTR">When the little woman, plainly garbed in a brown suit of corduroy,
					stepped to the front of the stage she was greeted with an outburst of applause
					which lasted ten minutes.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYTR">The playhouse was jammed. Hundreds were refused admission, and what
					was to have been a meeting tendered to a martyr became a jubilee accorded a
					victor.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYTR">Birth control was the topic of the evening, but this important subject
					was shelved at times for criticism of the Federal authorities, the unsympathetic
					public and the newspapers.</q>
			</p>
			<p><q who="NYTR">Prosecution was called persecution, the newspapers were thanked for
					advertising, "The Little Rebel,"and Mrs. Sanger herself brought a burst of
					applause when she declared:</q> "You can no longer say the courts do not serve
				their purpose, for in helping to promote the fight for birth control they have more
				than served a purpose.</p>
			<p><q who="NYTR">Mrs. <person reg="Cothren, Marion B.">Marion B. Cothren</person>,
					presiding, introduced Mrs. Sanger as</q> "<q who="COTMA">the little woman who
					has taken the first big step in this country which will ultimately lift the ban
					on birth control</q>."</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Mrs. Sanger Says Publicity Will Aid.</head>
			<p>"Women want birth control in this country, and organized action will bring it about.
				Publicity will hasten it,"<q who="NYTR"> said Mrs. Sanger.</q></p>
			<p>"When birth control leagues are established here we will soon resolve all social
				problems, such as mental defectiveness, deformity, settlement problems and child
				labor conditions. We will practically wipe out infant mortality. I have made a study
				of conditions abroad and have a message for you tonight." <place reg="Netherlands"
					>Holland</place> has the lowest death rate of infants in the world. There they
				have fifty-seven clinics for teaching birth control in most densely populated
				districts."</p>
			<p>"In <place>France</place> conditions are just the opposite, and the infant mortality
				is the highest in the world, because the authorities and clergy have fought birth
				control. <place>England</place> is almost in the same condition. There is a greater
				need in this country for the work. The facilities and equipment are much better. We
				can outstrip all <place>Europe</place> in ten years if this matter is taken up. The
				trouble over here is that we are regulated by conventions."</p>
			<p>"Pardon me if I refuse to thank the government because I am now free and no longer a
				criminal. How kind of the government after a persecution of two years to tell the
				people of New York I am an orderly person. Two years ago I was branded."</p>
			<p>"Tonight I thank the grand jury for indicting me. I thank the Federal authorities for
				fanning the flame, and I thank the dear newspapers for publicity. They have done
				wonders to arouse interest in birth control."</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Will Establish Clinics.</head>
			<p>
				<q who="NYTR">Mrs. Sanger, who will leave in two weeks to establish clinics in
					several Western cities, charged the government with "contemptible spying" into
					her home, and said overtures were continually made to compromise the case.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"Why, the <person reg="Marshall, H. Snowden">United States Attorney</person>," she
				declared, "declared to me that the birth control reading matter would be all right
				if written for an American magazine, but written in such direct, plain and simple
				language was too much for the <place>United States</place> mails."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYTR">The birth control movement has the hearty sanction of at least one New
					York physician. Dr. <person reg="Goldwater, Abraham L.">A.L. Goldwater</person>,
					brother of the former <person reg="Emerson, Haven">Health Commissioner,</person>
					assailed brother members of his profession.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"<q who="GOLAL">Half the physicians are opposed to birth control,</q>" he said, "<q
					who="GOLAL">because it will cut down their incomes. This is a work the medical
					profession should be identified with. I am pleased to give it my hearty
					endorsement. It is unfortunate you have to defy the law to crystallize public
					sentiment.</q>"</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYTR"><person reg="Goldman, Emma">Emma Goldman,</person> who will face trial
					next Monday for alleged indiscreet utterances on birth control, lost an
					opportunity to speak at the conclusion of the meeting. A sympathizer made an
					eloquent plea for her, but when he glanced about she was not in the
					audience.</q>
