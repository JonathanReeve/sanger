            <head>Birth Control Clinic Here, Sanger Plan </head>
            <p>
                <q who="CDT">Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, birth
                    control advocate, who recently spent thirty days in a <place reg="New York, NY"
                        >New York</place> jail for disseminating forbidden literature, is seriously
                    considering establishing a birth control clinic in the stockyards district and
                    making <place reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</place> the national headquarters for
                    the birth control propaganda throughout the <place>United States</place>. She
                    arrived here yesterday and found already 200 letters from Chicagoans asking for
                    the information which she is ready to give.</q></p>
            <p>"Chicago, it seems, more than any other city wants this information,” <q who="CDT"
                    >said Mrs. Sanger.</q> “The deeply appealing human need expressed in these
                letters is one of the most touching things I have ever known. And there are so many
                letters."</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <head type="sub"> Chicago the Logical Place. </head>
            <p> “I feel that Chicago is the logical headquarters because Chicago is the most
                democratic city I know, and this is distinctly a democratic movement."</p>
            <p>"There is great opposition to having New York the center, for birth control is
                considered a pink tea movement there, since so many society women have ‘taken it
                up.’ The people naturally do not want it to be placed in the hands of women with
                lorgnettes, who will make it an affair of class and will ask so many questions
                before they are willing to give out the information that it will be too late to do
                any good.”</p>
            <p><q who="CDT"> Mrs. Sanger, herself the mother of two boys, considers birth control
                    the only real propaganda for patriotism and preparedness.</q></p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <head type="sub">Stock-Taking in Nation.</head>
            <p>“If conscription goes through,” <q who="CDT">she said</q>, “we shall have a
                stock-taking of our national fitness, and get some statistics which will be rather
                startling, I fancy. How long will it be before we realize the necessity for bearing
                only those children who can properly be supported, instead of continuing as we are
                now doing, producing families of degenerates, who are of no use to themselves or any
                one else. If people will only realize that I do not preach abortion they would
                accept the idea, I am sure.</p>
            <p>“This distinction is to be the subject of my Sunday afternoon lecture.”</p>
            <p><q who="CDT">In addition to this afternoon’s lecture at the <org reg="Strand Theater"
                        >Strand theater</org> there will be another talk in the evening, and a
                    lecture on Tuesday afternoon, which both men and women will attend. <person
                        reg="Bemis, Anna">Mrs. Edward Bemis </person> of 4818 Sheridan Road will
                    introduce Mrs. Sanger.</q></p>
