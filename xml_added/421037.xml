				<p> Before leaving <place reg="Chicago, IL">the city</place>, she said, she will
					devote time to active organization work, and plans to carry her campaign to the

				<p> Crime, overpopulation, and disease would be checked by scientific birth control,
					Mrs. Margaret Sanger noted birth control advocate, said here Tuesday. </p>
			</q>
			<q who="BG">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger opened her midwestern campaign for amendment of the <name
						reg="United States Penal Code">federal laws</name> prohibiting the spread of
					contraceptive information with a speech before the Illinois Birth Control league
					and representatives of the <org>Brush Foundation for the Study of Birth
						Control</org> at <place reg="Cleveland, OH">Cleveland</place>. </p>
			</q>
			<p> “In the five years we have been conducting clinics in <place>New York</place>,” <q
					who="BG">she said,</q> “we have cared for 13,000 women and we know we have saved
				90 percent of them from death.”</p>

			<head type="sub">Cites Alleged Good</head>
			<p> “We have reduced maternal and infant mortality by insisting on a three-year interval
				between children, and thus relieved the crowding of homes.” </p>
			<q who="BG">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger denounced the prosecution of Mrs. <person reg="Dennett, Mary Ware"
						>Mary Ware Dennett</person>, grandmother-author of a sex book, who was fined
					$300 by a New York judge. </p>
			</q>
			<p> “All New York is indignant about Mrs. Dennett’s trial,” <q who="BG">she
					declared.</q> “Her pamphlet has been used by religious organizations for 10
				years. <org>The Union Theological seminary</org>, the <org>Young Woman’s Christian
					association</org> and the <org>Young Men’s Christian association</org> have been
				using it as textbook.”</p>
			<q who="BG">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger plans to organize a committee of 1,000 here to work for amendment of
					the federal penal code provisions in regard to birth control. </p>
			</q>

			<head type="sub">Sees Progress</head>
			<p> “Chicago has five birth control clinics and will eventually be a greater field for
				our work than New York,” <q who="BG">she predicted.</q> “This city, with its large
				population of mixed nationalities, needs scientific birth control.</p>
			<p> “Under the present penal code even a reputable doctor may not legally furnish
				information or advice on this important matter. In 10 years, however, the government
				will be organizing birth control clinics as an essential part of the program of
				material and infant welfare.” </p>
