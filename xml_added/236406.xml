		<head>Is Motherhood Sacred?</head>
		<p><person>Pres Bank of England</person>--</p>
		<p>Reminded me of <person reg="Wells, H.G.">H.G. Wells</person> prophecy.</p>
		<p>Conditions of Social &amp; Economic chaos today stem back to the careless, reckless, <gap
				extent="one word" reason="illegible"/> prolific breeding of our forebears who while
			giving up service to such ideas as the “Sacred work of Mother” the “<q>Sacredness of
				Motherhood</q>” did nothing to dignify or to enoble <add>it</add> or to protect the
			fundamental rights of mothers or to give them knowledge &amp; freedom whereby Mothers
			could bring into the world only the number of children she could bear &amp; rear as a
			service to the Country &amp; to the race.</p>
		<p>Motherhood throughout the ages has been the stepping stones for Oligarchies Kingdoms
			&amp; Democracies. It has been the upon this Sacred function that Tyrants &amp; War
			Lords have ascended to heights of renown.</p>
