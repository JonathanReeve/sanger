			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger said that the hour for birth control had struck not only in the west
					but throughout the entire world. It was the most revolutionary idea of the
					twentieth century, and it had become a part of their civilisation. It was
					impossible to ignore it.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> Since the beginning of human society there had always existed some method to
					control population. Nature’s way of keeping down population lay in famines,
					floods, pestilences and other calamities, but the methods adopted now were quite
					different. There were two ways of controlling population: to increase the death
					rate and lower the birth rate, or to emigrate. Thanks to the national policies
					followed by the countries of the world, emigration had become an impossibility,
					except to the underpopulated regions of South America. The only alternative
					therefore was to increase the death-rate and decrease the birth-rate. </p>
			</q>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub"> Nature’s Process Hindered</head>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> There were, however, factors operation in the world which hindered nature’s way
					of controlling population. The growth of humanitarianism, with its organised
					charities, philanthropic institutions and movements was interfering with
					Nature’s process of elimination of the undesirable and unfit types of people,
					who were being maintained at the expense of society. The existence of such a
					class of people was a danger to civilisation, as they were using up the energy
					and resources of the world, without in any way adding to them.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> She said the two greatest problems of present day civilisation were pressure of
					population upon its means of subsistence, and the reconciliation of humanitarian
					ideals with projects to improve the race.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger declared that each child, before it was born, had a right to be
					assured of a decent standard of existence. It was the duty of parents to
					ascertain whether they could give a fair condition of existence to the child.
					Even nations subjected the entry of other peoples into the territories to severe
					tests. </p>
			</q>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub"> Handicaps to Knowledge</head>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> The lecturer then contrasted large and small families, and observed that much of
					the misery noticed in large family groups could be avoided if people had a
					proper knowledge of the means of controlling a family’s numbers. The greatest
					handicaps in the way of carrying knowledge to the people were their prejudice,
					ignorance and financial inability to acquire such knowledge.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> The lecturer said a period of two to four years should be allowed between each
					childbirth. No man or woman should undertake the duty of parenthood before they
					had passed the period of adolescence. No more children should be brought into
					the world than parents were economically able to take care of. There must be a
					period of adjustment after marriage during which the man might know the woman as
					a woman and not as a child-bearing machine.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> Discussing modern methods of birth control, Mrs. Sanger said the first, which
					had the approval of all religions, was continence or celibacy. That, however,
					was possible only to a few and could not be forced on others. The second method
					was sterilisation of the unfit. A third method was the chemical process. That
					had to be employed according to the special needs of individuals.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger advocated the opening of clinics where men and women could get
					proper knowledge and materials for birth control. She urged the women of
						<place>India</place> to take a special interest in that respect.</p>
			</q>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub"> New Race Evolving</head>
			<p>
				<q who="TIMES">She concluded.</q> “We believe there is evolving in this world,
				through experiment, a new race. We believe that birth control and eugenic ideas are
				the corner-stones of this new structure.”</p>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> Sir Nusserwanji Choksey, proposing a vote of thanks to the speaker, asserted
					that birth control was a matter of vital importance to India.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="TIMES">
				<p> Dr. <person reg="Erulkar, Abraham Solomon">A.S. Erulkar</person>, while thanking
					Mrs. Sanger, said that he did not agree with her that continence was a method of
					birth control. As a doctor it was his view that continence in a normal person
					was not only impossible but positively undesirable.</p>
			</q>
			<p>
				<q who="TIMES">Dr. Miss <person reg="Mistri, Jerbanoo E.">Jerbanoo E.
						Mistri</person> seconding the vote of thanks, stated that medical women in
					Bombay thought that self-control was the best and most reliable means of birth
					control, but that being an ideal artificial birth control was a case of</q>
				<q who="MISJE">“needs must.”</q>
				<q who="TIMES">They did not approve it, however, to the extent of enabling married
					people to shirk the responsibilities of marriage. She declared that advice on
					birth control should be given by only qualified doctors and to married women
					only and that, too, on medical grounds.</q>
