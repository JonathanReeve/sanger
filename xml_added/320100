<p>There will be a business meeting of the women of <org reg="Socialist Party of New York City">Branch 5</org> on Wednesday,
December 13, at 8 p.m., in the Harlem Forum, 360 West 125th street.  All women Comrades who
have had lists of the Socialist men Comrades, and the enrolled voters, to call on them and interest
the wives and women of the family, will please attend this meeting and report of the results you
have had.  If you have not seen all on your list try to do so before Wednesday, so that you can
take up other work.</p>
<p>The work is to be divided into districts with a woman organizer to every assembly district,
who will subdivide the work into election districts.  In this way the whole territory of the branch
can be covered, and with a woman organizer of the branch the work can be carried on in
conjunction with the general work of the branch in a systematic way.</p>
