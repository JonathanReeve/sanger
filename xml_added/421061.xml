			<p>
				<q who="HP">Men, in organized groups, have taken a greater interest in birth control
					than women in the same status, it was declared today by Mrs. Margaret Sanger,
					nationally known birth control advocate, who spoke at the <org
						reg="Altrusa Club">Altrusa Club</org>luncheon on “Family Security.”</q>
			</p>
			<p>“Men seem to realize its social importance with reference to relief and
				unemployment,” <q who="HP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “Women are interested as
				individuals but after they find out information, they are through being interested.”

			<head type="sub">Population Great</head>
		
			<p>
				<q who="HP">Statistics showing the decline of the birth rate doesn’t mean anything,
					because the population is greater, Mrs. Sanger said.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“Remember, there was a 17-million population increase from 1920 to 1930,” <q who="HP"
					>she said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="HP">She quoted 1932 statistics given at the <org>American Conference on
						Birth Control and National Recovery</org> in <place reg="Washington, D.C."
						>Washington</place>by <person reg="Sydenstricker, Edgar">Edgar
						Sydenstricker</person>.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“The average annual birth rate in families on relief was 53 per cent higher than in
				those not on relief,” <q who="HP">she said.</q> “The birth rate in families which
				were receiving relief in 1932 was 210 as against 137 in families which were not
				receiving relief, a survey in four cities revealed."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HP">Mrs. Sanger does not blame the families on relief, but the authorities
					and organizations in every community, she said.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“They won’t take a stand to enable these people to get the information they should
				have,” <q who="HP">she said.</q></p>

			<head type="sub">Blames Representative</head>
		
			<p>
				<q who="HP">She also blames <person reg="Sumners, Hatton">Rep. Hatton
						Sumners</person>, chairman of the <org reg="House Judiciary Committee">House
						Judiciary committee</org>, for keeping the Birth Control Bill in the
					committee last year.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“<person reg="Ashurst, Henry Fountain">Senator Ashurst</person> of <place

				<q who="HP">Mrs. Sanger expects a fight against establishing a birth control clinic

			</p>
			<p>“But I believe the people in Dallas will put up a good fight for the clinic,”<q
					who="HP">she said</q> “Such a clinic was established in six weeks’ time in
					<place reg="Tucson, Arizona">Tucson</place>.”</p>
			<p>“A business man paid a year’s rent for a cottage as headquarters. Co-operation is
				being given by the <org reg="Pima County Medical Society">County Medical

			<p>
				<q who="HP">Mrs. Sanger will confer with a group of El Paso men and women this

			<head type="sub">Mrs. Sanger Meets at Luncheon with El Paso Doctors.</head>
		
			<p>
				<q who="HP">Conscious control of the birth rate was stressed as the most important
					factor aimed for by the <org
						reg="Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control">National Committee
						on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org>, Mrs. Sanger said at the <org
						reg="Altrusa International">Altrusa Club</org> luncheon yesterday.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“We control everything nowadays except the most important thing of all,” <q who="HP"
					>she said</q>. “We control our tempers, our appetites, our currency. But we
				allow the increase of children who cannot be given a chance at life, in homes which
				can not afford them, do not want them. And we carry the burden in our social
				program.”</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HP">No intelligence is being shown in the relief work, in any work for
					charity when children of unfit parents, or poverty-stricken parents are brought
					into the world in an increasing number, Mrs. Sanger pointed out.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“It is like trying to cure the cancer by burning it on top,” <q who="HP">she
					said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="HP">The average cost to maintain a person through the birth control clinic
					would be $2 a year, Mrs. Sanger said.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“Would you like to have knowledge?”<q who="HP"> is the question asked women at
					clinics.</q></p>
			<p>“It is taking the information out of the pornographic class and giving it out from
				scientific centers which take care of the individual needs of the women,”<q who="HP"
					> Mrs. Sanger said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="HP">She said that 51,000 women had been taken care of in her own New York
					Clinic, for which she served 30 days in jail.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“I never spent a better 30 days in my life,”<q who="HP">she said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="HP">In advocating young couples’ waiting two years after marriage to have
					children, Mrs. Sanger said:</q>
			</p>
			<p>“We have got to make more of marriage. We have never had the development of the
				woman. The boy never knows the girl as a woman. He knows her as a girl and next as
				mother of children.</p>
			<p>“The wife never knows herself as a woman. She never gets the spiritual and mental
				development which should be hers between girlhood and motherhood.”</p>
			<p>“There are 47 states with conflicting laws on birth control,” <q who="HP">Mrs. Sanger
					said. <place>California</place>bootlegs her supplies to take care of her 14
					clinics under her own law, she said.</q></p>
