		<head>Mrs. Sanger Lectures on Birth Control </head>
		<div type="section">

			<p>
				<q who="HC">Maintaining that <place reg="United States">this country</place> should
					be at least as careful of the type of citizens born here as it is of the type of
					citizens admitted, Mrs. Margaret Sanger of <place reg="New York, NY">New
						York</place> presented the case for birth control at a lecture held under
					the auspices of the <org reg="Connecticut Birth Control League, Hartford Branch"
						>Hartford Branch</org> of the <org>Connecticut Birth Control League</org> in
					the parish house of <org reg="St. John's Episcopal Church">St. John’s
						Church</org>, Saturday afternoon.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HC"> The lecture was attended by nearly 500 persons, many of whom signed
					cards pledging support of action to liberalize the state and Federal laws on
					dissemination of birth control information.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Connecticut Laws Scored.</head>

			<p>
				<q who="HC">Mrs. Sanger repeated her assertion that <place>Connecticut</place> laws
					on the dissemination of birth control information are</q> “unique," <q who="HC"
					>pointing out that there are only two other states in the county where even
					physicians are forbidden to give even oral information to patients on the
					subject. The state law which prohibits the use of contraceptives is
					unenforceable, she declared, unless the State proposes to station a policeman in
					every home.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HC"> In opening her lecture Mrs. Sanger pointed out that the old methods of
					keeping the population relatively stable such as pestilence, famine, floods,
					etc., have been largely overcome by science. It is obvious, she said, that there
					are only two methods to control the population, increase deaths or decrease
					births and the former is much too cruel. In times past persons have resorted to
					infanticide as a method of controlling the number of children, but this is to be
					deplored, as is abortion, which followed infanticide as a method of controlling
					the size of the family, she said. </q>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Says Question Affects All. </head>

			<p><q who="HC">Once contraception is generally known there will be no necessity for
					either of the previous two methods of control, she said. She pointed out that
					the so-called “social problem” group is in a large part composed of families
					where contraception is unknown, while in the other group both parents and
					children benefit through improved conditions. The question of birth control, she
					said, then affects every man and woman, and indirectly every child.</q> “The
				immigration laws bar certain aliens who are feeble-minded, or who have certain
				diseases, from admission to this country,” <q who="HC">she said. </q>“Certainly if
				it is desirable to control the rate at which such persons are permitted to multiply
				once they are here.” </p>
			<p>
				<q who="HC">Birth control is desirable to prevent the transmission of disease, to
					insure the proper spacing between children so that both mother and child shall
					have the benefit of better physical condition, to prevent child bearing
					adolescence, to permit families to have no more children than they can afford,
					and to permit a period of mutual adjustment after marriage, she said. </q>
