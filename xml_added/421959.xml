		<head>War Babies: Is This the Time For Them?</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="SLN">Should American parents fear to have more children now because of the
					danger and insecurity caused by the greatest of history’s wars?</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="SLN">From coast to coast they are raising that query.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="SLN">So the question was laid before two well known authorities. </q>
			</p>

			<p>
				<q who="SLN"> First was Mrs. <person reg="Gruenberg, Sidonie Matsner">Sidonie
						Gruenberg</person>, head of the <org>Child Study Association</org> and
					author of "<title type="article">We, the Parents</title>," which won the 1940
						<title type="journal">Parent’s Magazine</title> award for outstanding
					service to parents and the home.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="SLN"> Second was Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret
						Sanger</person>, head of the <org reg="Birth Control Federation of America"
						>American Federation of Birth Control</org>, who has battled for years--and
					even been in jail--for her beliefs that women should have the freedom to
					control the size of their families. </q>
			</p>

		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Here's the Result</head>
			<p>
				<q who="SLN">They swung to bat on the question, with answers diametrically
					opposed.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="GRUSI">"There are more reasons than ever for having children now,"</q>
				<q who="SLN">said Mrs. Gruenberg, who is the mother of four (two sons are
					physicians) and the grandmother of two.</q>
				<q who="GRUSI">"Children are going to build the future--and it must be good. The
					world is ill now, but that does not mean it cannot recover. Much of the recovery
					depends on a strong youth, which will help to build a better world."</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="GRUSI">"<person reg="Hitler, Adolf">Hitler</person> never could have come to
					power if it had not been for the restlessness and despair of the youth of
						<place>Germany</place> over the bleak outlook it faced following the last
					war. Hitler has taught us that the earth cannot have sick spots and remain well.
					If we don't have children and build up a strong youth for the future, we shall
					be a sick spot ourselves."</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="GRUSI">"Besides I don't believe there is a valid reason for swinging away
					from normal. My children were born about the time of the first World War, when
					we believed the world was being made safe for democracy. Twenty-five years have
					shown that we were wrong in that assumption. It's just as reasonable to assume
					that the black outlook which many people see now is not a correct calculation
					either. So I see no valid reason for fearing to have children now."</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="GRUSI">"I want to make it quite clear that I am not talking about breeding
					just to increase the race. I believe that married people who are able bodied,
					intelligent and resourceful should have children and I am talking to those who
					want to, but are afraid. Children are a fulfilment and a long range stake in the
					future.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="SLN"> Mrs. Sanger, child of a large family, the mother of two physician sons
					and a daughter who died at five, gave her views on the question by long distance
					telephone from <place reg="Tucson, AZ">Tucson, Arizona</place>.</q>
			</p>

		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub"> Mental Hazards </head>
			<p> “It is a very bad time to have children,” <q who="SLN">she said.</q> “There are
				three reasons. First, the administration is trying its utmost to get people worried
				about the future. It wants us all to have a serious attitude about the insecurity of
				the future. Such a feeling creates a wrong condition under which to have children.
				It’s a known fact that many of the children born in this country after their
				parents’ arrival from <place>Europe</place> as immigrants have had menial
				retardation because of the mental insecurity of the parents upon their arrival. </p>
			<p> “Second, glandular upsets of the mothers during a period of worry and anxiety affect
				the unborn child. </p>
			<p> “And finally, in case the children should be born healthy, we have the nutrition
				question, to say nothing of the mental atmosphere of deprivation in the home.” </p>
			<p> “Every mother in this country who wants to have a healthy normal child should wait
				until there is assurance of security for the child and parents too.”</p>
			<q who="SLN">
				<p> Dr. Gruenberg has an answer to the question of adequate nutrition for wartime
					babies.</p>
			</q>
			<p>
				<q who="GRUSI">“I believe that it is part of national defense,”</q>
				<q who="SLN">she said,</q>
				<q who="GRUSI">“to establish milk stations and school lunches to make sure that
					children born in wartime should have adequate food.”</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub"> World Outlook </head>

			<p>
				<q who="SLN"> Meanwhile, let’s see how many babies are actually being born. Figures
					on the birthrate (the numbers of live births per 1,000 population) show there
					has been a steady decrease in the birthrate in all civilized nations since 1880
					until the last few years. In the <place>United States</place> (after a long
					decline which hit a low of 16.6 in 1933) it moved up to 17.6 in 1938 and in 1941
					showed a marked increase to 19.0, said to be largely due to wartime marriages
					and business upswing. <place>England</place>’s birthrate has shown a very small
					decrease since 1938, when it was 15.1 and provisional records show still more
					decline- to about 14.2- for 1941. </q>
			</p>

			<p>
				<q who="SLN">
					<place>Germany</place>’s birthrate fell like a waterfall in a record low of 14.7
					in 1933, spurted upward to 18.0 in 1934 and continued the increase to 20.4 in
					1940- a rise credited to Hitler’s steps to encourage the birth of more children.
						<place>Italy</place>’s birthrate has shown a systematic decline for many
					years and <person reg="Mussolini, Benito">Mussolini</person>’s effort to arrest
					it have met with only slight success in the last few years. It moved from 22.4
					in 1936 to 23.7 in 1938 and back to 23.4 in 1939. <place>Japan</place>, with the
					largest birthrate of all (averaging from 30.6 in 1937 to 26.7 in 1938-) an
					unusually long skid for so short a time. No later figures are available on Japan
					now. </q>
