		<head>Mrs. Sanger Forecasts Use of Tea for Birth Control</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Women may soon be able to prevent pregnancy by drinking a cup of tea
					brewed from a Southwestern shrub, Mrs. Margaret Sanger, founder of the birth
					control movement, believes.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"Birth control tea is now one of the major research projects," <q who="EPHP">Mrs.
					Sanger said at the <org reg="El Paso Planned Parenthood Center">Planned
						Parenthood Center</org> at 1926 Arizona street.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">She arrived here yesterday from her home in <place reg="Tucson, AZ"
						>Tucson</place> to confer with <place reg="El Paso, TX">El Paso</place>
					Planned Parenthood officials.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Indians Use It</head>
			<p>"Birth control tea is made from a shrub called the gromlin," <q who="EPHP">Mrs.
					Sanger said.</q> "The Navajo Indians have used it for many years. This shrub, a
				cousin to the forget-me-not, is now being tried out in England, under scientific
				auspices."</p>
			<p>"We think it works by making the ovum resistant to pregnancy. But it is still in the
				experimental stage.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">The tea is one of four new birth control drugs undergoing experiment,
					Mrs. Sanger disclosed. The others are secret formula pills, hormones, and
					injections.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Easier and Cheaper</head>
			<p>"None of these will be recommended for general use until they are proven effective
				and harmless,"<q who="EPHP"> she said.</q> "They may replace current contraceptive
				techniques providing temporary sterility and making it easier and cheaper for poor
				people to practice planned parenthood."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger said she was amazed and encouraged at Progress made in
					birth control in <place>Japan</place> and <place>India</place>, where she
					visited last year. In both countries the governments are financing birth control
					clinics, <org reg="India Government">India</org> having allotted $1.3 million
					for the work in 1953, she added.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Japan and India</head>
			<p>"I predict that Japan and India will solve their birth control problem before we do,"
					<q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> "In those countries it is the masses who
				most need it, who have had no birth control. The present movement reaches the
				masses."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">At last year's <org
						reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 3rd">international PP
						conference</org> in <place reg="Bombay, India">Bombay</place> Mrs. Sanger
					was named president of the <org
						reg="International Planned Parenthood Federation">world federation</org> for
						<place>North America</place>, and <person reg="Rama Rau, Dhanvanthi">Lady
						Rama Rau</person>, who is planning a <place reg="United States">U.S.</place>
					visit, was named president for the <place reg="Asia">Orient</place>.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">In El Paso Mrs. Sanger was greeted by <person reg="Harvey, Maude P."
						>Mrs. C. M. Harvey</person>, an El Paso board member who arranged the noted
					birth control advocate's first speech in El Paso 16 years ago.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">She also conferred with <person reg="Price, Winifred">Mrs. David
						Price</person>, executive board president, and other officials. She was a
					guest of <person reg="Goetting, Mary Betty">Mrs. Charles Goetting</person>,
					honorary president. The need for erecting a new clinic in El Paso was
					discussed.</q>
