		<p>In the death of <person reg="Chance, Clinton F.">Clinton Chance</person> I have lost not
			only a close friend but an invaluable adviser and co-worker in the cause of planned
			parenthood.</p>
		<p>Back in 1920, on one of my annual visits to <place reg="London, England">London</place>,
			Clinton was taking a psychological view of the future possibilities of planned
			parenthood movement. He was a keen observer of character and believed in giving support
			not only to ideals but to action. In our final summing-up of activities and dreams of
			conquests he said “<q who="CHACL">Let me know when there is an important job to do and
				money needed for it</q>”. </p>
		<p>A few months later the decision of the <org reg="New York State Appellate Court"
				>Appellate Court of <place>New York</place></org> was given that doctors could give
			contraceptive advice to patients. I cabled Clinton that I could get a <person
				reg="Bocker, Dorothy">woman doctor</person> to open a Birth Control Clinic but that
			five thousand dollars was needed for her salary and the clinic set-up for the first
			year--was he interested? The cable in reply said “<q who="CHACL">Go ahead. Cheque
				follows</q>”. That was the first legal clinic under medical supervision to be opened
			in the <place reg="United States">U.S.A.</place> and from it sprang some 600 clinics. </p>
		<p>Clinton was too modest to take credit for the important part he had played in the planned
			parenthood movement. His left hand did not know what his right hand gave out. </p>
		<p>It is good to have indelible memories of a man like Clinton Chance, of his honest
			forthright opinions, of his vision and loyalty and truth, of his wit and laughter in the
			midst of turmoil. He was a man, a friend, I am proud to have known. </p>
