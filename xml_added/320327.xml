		<head>SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION IN SPAIN.</head>
		<p>THE term "free-thinker" applied to one in <place>Spain </place>is considered a mark of
			advanced ideas. Other terms such as "liberal", "republican", are used to classify
			certain stages of one's development, which to an American seem like relics of a past
			age. The free-thinker who is accepted by all respectables as <emph rend="italics"
				>the</emph> most progressive is in reality usually a generation behind in general
			phases of thought. </p>
		<p>It is the Anarchist in Spain who is alive to the broader interests of life, and it is and
				<supplied resp="MSPP">has</supplied> been the anarchists who have done more in
			proportion to their number to educate and to promote a desire for education amongst the
			working people, than any other organization. They are the only educators who offer to
			the Spanish people a program of life and society which naturally applies to the Spanish
			temperament as well as being consistent with their conduct.</p>
		<p>If we can realize what it means to attempt to educate a people where in a population of
			17,667,256 there are 11,945,971 out of that number who are illiterate, who can neither
			read nor write, then one may be able to understand the importance of the work of the
			Anarchist propaganda and the difficulties which confronted <person
				reg="Ferrer i Guardia, Francisco">Francisco Ferrer</person>. It is impossible
			to separate Anarchism from Spanish education or from anything which is important in
			Spain, for it is the only spark of life there today. It will be left to the Anarchist to
			drive out the priests and the robbers, before Spain can step freely in any
			direction.</p>
		<p>Organized anarchy in Spain dates back to the year 1868, when the <org
				reg="International Workingmen's Association">International Association of
				Workers</org> was formed, the result of which was the <org
				reg="Spanish Federation Congress of 1870">First National Congress</org> held in
				<place reg="Barcelona, Spain">Barcelona</place> in 1870. So great was the interest
			in these ideals and so rapidly did they spread, that the following year the Government
			declared the International to be an illegal organization and the executive left Spanish
			soil and fled to <place>Portugal</place>. A <org
				reg="AIT-Secco Portuguesa">Portugese organization</org> was soon
			established and the ideas flourished on both soils. </p>
		<p>In spite of the law declaring the International Association of Workers illegal, several
			conferences were held throughout Spain. The movement became so strong and general that
			the Republicans attempted to capture it by swinging it into a political groove, but
			failed. The Spaniard has little faith in government, no matter what its brand, so they
			kept to one straight issue-- Revolution through economic action. They supported <person
				reg="Bakunin, Mikhail">Bakunin</person> at the famous <org
				reg="Congress of the International Workingmen's Association, 6th">Conference at
					<place reg="Geneva, Switzerland">Geneva</place> in 1873</org> in this. </p>
		<p>The <org reg="Spain Government">Government</org> realized the importance of the movement
			when it saw it could not be side-tracked into a political camp. The issue was too
			straight to be tolerated, at all costs it must be crushed; it accordingly took steps to
			dissolve it and smash the organization by arresting and banishing the prominent members
			to penal settlements in the <place reg="Marianne Islands, Micronesia">Marianne
				Islands</place>. This had the desired effect and many members abandoned the movement
			entirely, while others simply withdrew their activities. For several years it remained
			at a standstill until in 1889, when a new program was drawn up upon which was based
			Modern Anarchism in Spain.</p>
		<p>I will not attempt to tell of the hardships, strifes and struggles of these who were able
			to keep the propaganda current and the ideals alive in the face of persecutions,
			tortures and executions. There was no conceivable plot which the criminal tactics of the
			police and the priests did not resort to in order to incriminate sympathizers and to
			extinguish anarchist ideals. Whole issues of both daily and weekly papers were
			confiscated by the government day after day and week after week.</p>
		<p>One anarchist four-page daily, "<title type="journal"><foreign lang="SPA">Tierra y
					Libertad</foreign></title>," (<title type="journal">Land and Liberty</title>),
			which in 1905 had a circulation of 10,000 copies, had to be converted into a weekly with
			8,000 copies. This is only one instance--there are many others--but it is estimated very
			roughly and conservatively that at the present time there are more than 70,000 copies of
			current anarchist papers, weekly, daily, etc., and we know there are always two or three
			readers to every purchase, which goes to prove that suppression and confiscation may
			delay or hold back for a time, but ideals cannot be killed and often take root while
			they stand.</p>
		<p>Anarchists attribute the poverty, ignorance and misery to present day society. They
			believe a society can be established in which Law, authority, government or church shall
			not dictate or regulate human conduct, but that mutual help through natural desires will
			give individual freedom.</p>
		<p>Spanish Anarchism embraces the philosophy of Bakunin, <person
				reg="Reclus, Elisee">Reclus</person> and <person
				reg="Kropotkin, Peter">Kropotkin</person>. They consistently advocate the general
			strike to bring about the social revolution.</p>
