		<head>A LETTER FROM MARGARET SANGER</head>
		<p>THERE seems to be general dissatisfaction among the readers of <title type="journal"
				>MOTHER EARTH</title> over the result of my trial.</p>
		<p>Many of them have written me that the law remains unchanged. That any man or woman may
			still be rushed into prison, whose case may not be "dismissed."</p>
		<p>True--all too true.</p>
		<p>The Socialists have been telling us this for years. They have been telling us that "<q
				who="UNK">direct action" does not accomplish anything until the laws are
			changed</q>."</p>
		<p>You have taken an interest in my trial. You have written letters to <person
				reg="Dayton, Alston G.">Judge Dayton,</person>
			<person reg="Content, Harold A.">U.S. Dist. Attorney</person> and other officials
			requesting the dismissal of my case-You have pleaded the Cause of Birth Control thru
			thousands of letters to these officials-you have been heard-the authorities dismissed
			the case, as you requested-and now you are disappointed and "mad" at ME because they did
			it.</p>
		<p>I made no requests of the authorities: on the contrary I informed them, before the case
			was dismissed, that I should continue my work until working women in <place
				reg="United States">America</place> should have the same freedom to get Birth
			Control knowledge as the women of wealth.</p>
		<p>I have tried to tell you that going into jail or staying out of it was of slight
			importance to me. My work--my Cause, is the cry of anguish which comes to me from the
			women of <place reg="United States, Southern">the Cotton Belt</place>-the cry of working
			women tortured with the dread of child bearing and begging for relief from it. I am free
			and have relieved nearly three hundred of these women in the past four weeks: to
			continue to do this work-via direct action-is my Cause.</p>
		<p><person reg="Sanger, William">William Sanger</person> went to jail-the law remained the
			same-I did not go to jail-you say the law remains the same. Then the Socialists must be
			right. Will <person reg="Goldman, Emma">Emma Goldman</person>'s trial change the law, or
			will it serve as William Sanger's and my case has served-as precedents only? Opinions
			expressed by several prominent members of the legal profession have been to the effect
			that the "dismissal" of my case by the <org reg="United States Government"
				>Government</org> is of far greater value as a precedent than an acquittal by a
			jury.</p>
		<p>Comrades-let's on with our work and stop quibbling.</p>
