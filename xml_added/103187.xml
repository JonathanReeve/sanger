		<head>A MESSAGE TO THE WOMEN OF <place>CHINA</place></head>
		<p>The most significant change which has occurred in the Western world in the Nineteenth
			Century has been the revolt of women against sex servility. In other worlds, it has been
			the refusal of women to consider themselves mere breeding machines which has given woman
			her place of dignity and power in the Western world. </p>
		<p>We know now that the most important force in the re-making of the world is a free and
			conscious Motherhood. As women free themselves from accidental and unvoluntary breeding
			they set free not only the women, but the children, from poverty, misery and economical
			slavery. Birth control is the first step that women must make towards the goal of their
			freedom. It is the first and most important step that labor must take towards the goal
			of its emancipation. When women own and control their own bodies they will life
			Motherhood to the plane of a voluntary, intelligent function, and re-make and
			revolutionize our social system. When the world is thus remade it will exceed any dream
			of our present statesmen, reformers or idealists. For this is the fundamental step upon
			which Society to-day is based and upon which we must reconstruct a permanent social
			system.</p>
