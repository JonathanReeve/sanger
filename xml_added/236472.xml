			<p> 1. Is she entitled to knowledge? Just as we admit that the conditions around the
				married woman entitle her to knowledge so must we analyze the unmarried girl.</p>
			<p>There are three kinds of girls who go wrong:</p>
			<list>
				<item> 1. The innocent, ignorant girl who puts her trust and faith in the man and
					finds herself a mother.</item>
				<item> 2. The ignorant girl who thinks by giving herself to the man she likes will
					thereby hold him or get him to marry her.</item>
				<item> 3. The ignorant girl classes as moron with full physical sex development, but
					mental growth not above <add>a</add> child of nine or ten years; no moral
					standard, no control, no modesty; just goes with the man who asks her and takes
					what she gets, money or good time.</item>
			</list>
		</div>

		<div type="section">
			<p> 1. In the first case, this innocent girl should be as protected by society as the
				mother who suffers with tuberculosis, heart disease, or any other ailment of
				sickness which renders her weak against the consequences of pregnancy.</p>
			<p> So should innocence and ignorance be regarded. Society should protect the innocent
				and ignorant, as it protects the diseased by giving all knowledge to protect
				themselves against attacks. Should this weak girl be made to endure the “<q
					who="SHAWI">slings of outrageous fortune</q>” because of her innocence? Is this
				punishment justifiable, and is this the attitude that society takes with other
				examples of crime by innocence?</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<p> 2. This girl a little wiser and more knowing than her sister leans a bitter lesson,
				and could learn it just as well by not going through the bitter experience of
				motherhood. Such men are plentiful and girls are learning by examples that without
				love and tenderness there is no bond. This is the girl who aborts, and the man is
				more helpful in obtaining this release than he is when marriage and motherhood are
				suggested.</p>
			<p> Think of the innocent child in both cases and the effect of the mind of the mother
				upon its nine months’ journey to birth.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<p> 3. This type of girl is our national and social problem. She may be promiscuous, but
				is bright enough to escape jails or institutions. She is everywhere, in every walk
				of life--in all classes. When married, she is three times as prolific as the normal
				woman. While her illicit relations do harm only to herself or the man in question,
				should she be permitted to bear children?</p>
