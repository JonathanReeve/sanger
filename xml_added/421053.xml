			<p><q who="NSE">Although she said she believes in early marriage, especially in hard
					times, because a young couple can live together more cheaply than apart, Mrs.
					Sanger opposes the early assumption of the responsibility of children.
				</q>“There would be fewer divorces among young people,” she said, “If they could
				have at least two years to get really acquainted with each other and to have fun
				together before the children came.” </p>
