		<p><q who="NYT">Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> issued a
				statement yesterday in reply to the statement made by <person
					reg="Hayes, Patrick J.">Archbishop Hayes</person> on Sunday, setting forth the
				attitude of the <org>Roman Catholic Church</org> toward birth control. In it she
				said:"</q></p>
		<p>I agree with the <person reg="Hayes, Patrick J.">Archbishop</person> that a clinic is the
			proper place to give information on birth control. I wish, however, to point out the
			fact that there are two sides to the subject under consideration--the practical
			information as distinct from a theoretical discussion. The latter may be rightly
			discussed on the public platform and in the press, as the Archbishop himself has taken
			the opportunity to do. The object of the <org>American Birth Control League</org> is
			two-fold--to arouse public discussion on the theoretical issue as well as to establish
			clinics where the practical information may be given to mothers through the medical
			profession.</p>
		<p>The inference is often made by our opponents that the genius is born at the end of a
			large family, usually the eleventh or twelfth, or as quoted by the Archbishop, the
			fifteenth child (<person reg="Franklin, Benjamin">Franklin</person>.) If the Archbishop
			will recall his <title type="book">Bible</title> history he will find that some of the
			most remarkable characters were first children--and often the only child, as well. For
			instance, <person reg="Isaac (Biblical)">Isaac</person>, in whose seed all the nations
			were to be blessed, was an only child, born after long years of preparation. Isaacâ€™s
			only children were twins--<person reg="Jacob (Biblical)">Jacob</person>, the father of
			all <place>Israel</place>, and <person reg="Esau (Biblical)">Esau</person>. <person
				reg="Joseph (Biblical)">Joseph</person>, the child of <person
				reg="Rachel (Biblical)">Rachel</person>, was born late in her life, and she had but
			one other child. <person reg="Samuel (Biblical)">Samuel</person>, who judged Israel for
			forty years, was an only child, born after years of prayer and supplication on the part
			of <person reg="Hannah (Biblical)">Hannah</person>. <person
				reg="John the Baptist (Biblical)">John the Baptist</person> was an only child and
			his parents were well along in years when he was born. By the Roman Catholics, <person
				reg="Jesus Christ">Jesus</person> himself is said to be <person
				reg="Virgin Mary (Biblical)">Mary</person>'s first as well as her only child.</p>
