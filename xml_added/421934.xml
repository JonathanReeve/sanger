		<head>THREAT OF PRISON WON’T STOP “WOMAN REBEL” FROM ADVOCATING “BIRTH CONTROL”</head>

		<dateline><date value="1916-01-13"/>Jan. 13, <place reg="New York, NY">New
			York</place>--</dateline>
		<p>
			<q who="TDB">The woman rebel has just rebelled again! The apostle of birth control, the
				alleged author of scores of illegal pamphlets, Margaret H. Sanger, has announced
				that she is going to stand trial, undefended in a federal court here Tuesday, Jan.
				18. She must face a charge of circulating improper literature, preferred against her
				a year ago by the late <person reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony
				Comstock.</person></q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="TDB">Is Uncle Sam going to jail Margaret Sanger for an offense of which, her
				friends declare, every single newspaper and magazine in the nation which has
				discussed her case is just as guilty as she?</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="TDB">That is the dilemma which confronts the authorities today. Everybody, it
				seems, would be happier if she would only compromise and let the whole thing blow
				over!</q>
		</p>
		<p><q who="TDB">"Why is it,” Mrs. Sanger was asked, “that you have come back from
					<place>England</place> to undergo all the trouble now being stored up for you in
				the way of prosecution and imprisonment?</q>”</p>
		<p>“For the very reason,” <q who="TDB">answered Mrs. Sanger,</q> “that the affair might blow
			over. The great issue is to raise the question of birth control out of the gutter of
			obscenity, where my opponents have put it, and to get it into the light of intelligence
			and human understanding." </p>
		<p>“Few people know how rapidly, under the surface, the birth control movement is
			developing." </p>
		<p>“My reports from the west say that thousands of birth control pamphlets are being
			distributed there among the working people. They are being photographed, typewritten,
			mimeographed, even copied painfully out by hand, so that the information they contain
			may be spread from family to family."</p>
		<p> “I am going to stay in the fight, if I can, until the methods of birth control,
			recognized as legal, hygienic and moral in every other civilized nation, are made legal
			in this country also, and all the vile laws which class discussion of them as obscene
			are swept from the statute books." </p>
		<p>“I hope that my case may have the same result in this country as did that of <person
				reg="Besant, Annie">Annie Besant</person> in England. She was arrested a generation
			ago and found guilty. But the publicity given her case was such an aid to the birth
			control propaganda that England at last recognized it.”</p>
		<p> Mrs. Sanger is to be prosecuted under the postal laws, not on the charge of circulating
			the information as to methods of birth control, but simply for having written articles
			advocating it. These articles appeared in her magazine, <title type="journal">The Woman
				Rebel</title>. </p>
