		<head>Birth Control 1929</head>

		<p> The general aim of the birth control movement is to legitimatize the
			practice of contraception through scientific and hygienic methods,
			and to educate the adult public as to its advantages from the
			personal and social points of view. International in scope, the
			movement has been known under a number of names; in the <place
				reg="England">British Empire</place> as “neo-malthusianism”; in
				<place>France</place> as “conscious generation”; and
			occasionally as “voluntary parenthood.”</p>
		<div>
			<head type="sub">History and Present Status </head>
			<p>In English-speaking countries the present movement derives from
					<person reg="Malthus, Thomas">Malthus</person>. In the
				second edition of his famous <title>Essay on Population</title>,
				published in 1803, the English clergyman first enunciated his
				law of the pressure of population upon the means of subsistence.
				The only solution he suggested for overpopulation was the
				practice of celibacy and late marriage. In 1826 Dr. <person
					reg="Knowlton, Charles">Charles Knowlton</person>, a
					<place>Boston</place> physician, was prosecuted for
				publishing a small book, <title>The Fruits of
				Philosophy</title>, advocating mechanical and chemical methods
				of contraception. In 1876-1877 <person reg="Bradlaugh, Charles"
					>Charles Bradlaugh</person> and Mrs. <person
					reg="Besant, Annie"> Annie Besant </person>were prosecuted
				and convicted for distributing that book among the working
				classes of Great Britain. Their conviction led to the foundation
				of the Malthusian League in 1878 by Dr. <person
					reg="Drysdale, Charles">Charles Drysdale</person> and his
				wife, Dr. <person reg="Vickery Drysdale, Alice">Alice Vickery
					Drysdale</person>. A Dutch League was founded in 1881. The
				neo-malthusians differed from Malthus in advocating
				contraception to prevent overpopulation and to reduce the birth
				rate. The period between 1914 and 1921 in the United States was
				one of militant agitation and widespread publicity, partly as a
				result of several convictions of persons active in the movement
				for challenging federal and state laws. In <place> New York
					City</place> in 1914 <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs.
					Margaret Sanger </person>began to advocate contraception on
				feministic and libertarian grounds, coining at that time the
				term “birth control.” The interest awakened in the whole
				question of contraception resulted in 1921 in the foundation of
				the <org>American Birth Control League</org> and of the
					<org>Voluntary Parenthood League</org>; also in the
				publication of a monthly periodical, the <title>Birth Control
					Review</title>, edited by Mrs. Sanger. The two organizations
				were subsequently combined under the name of the former.
				Activities of the second period of the American movement, from
				1921 to 1925, included the organization of local leagues, the
				education of public opinion, and campaigns for the amendment of
				statutes which class the practice of contraception with
				obscenity and criminal abortion. During the third period, 1925
				to the present, advocates of birth control have concentrated
				upon the establishment of clinics and research bureaus, and upon
				enlisting th interest and activities of physicians, biologists,
				biochemists, and social scientists generally. Results of these
				efforts are seen in the fact that no less than 55 clinics and
				bureaus are now operating legitimately in the United States
				(covering 23 cities and 13 states), dispensing contraceptive
				information to all persons legally permitted to receive it. In
					<place>New York </place>State it is given to married people
				for the cure or prevention of disease. In <place>California
				</place>there are 12 clinics; there is one each in
					<place>Baltimore</place>, <place>Cincinnati</place>,
					<place>Cleveland,</place>
				<place>Denver,</place>
				<place>Detroit,</place>
				<place>Newark</place>, <place>New Haven</place>, and
					<place>Philadelphia</place>; there are six in
					<place>Chicago</place>; and <place>New York City</place> has
				eight in hospitals and one operating independently. In addition,
				a branch for colored women has recently been established in the
					<place>Harlem</place> section of New York City by the <org
					reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">Clinical
					Research Bureau</org>. The year 1929 was marked by the
				establishment of 27 new clinics. The successful operation of
				such clinics and research bureaus, under medical direction,
				makes possible the scientific analysis of individual cases, and
				also statistical studies. Through the latter material is being
				developed for the replacement of untested theory with impartial
				analysis. Social agencies are beginning to cooperate with such
				clinics. Owing to the widespread change in public opinion,
				physicians are more willing to give advice in private practice.
				Over 10,000 of them have expressed willingness to do so. The
				birth control movement is exerting a noticeable influence upon
				eugenics and giving a new direction to programs for
				race-betterment; it has resulted in renewed consideration of the
				problem of the legal sterilization of the unfit; and has
				influenced programs for the control of dependent, delinquent,
				and defective groups in society. It has been given consideration
				by many social agencies seeking to decrease maternal and infant
				mortality rates, particularly by the Committee on Maternal
				Health of New York City. Financial support of the birth control
				movement has been from independent and anonymous sources, with
				the exception of temporary support from the Brush Foundation of
				Cleveland. During 1929 a study of 10,000 case was made by the
				Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, and a study of fertility
				and sterility by the Committee on Maternal Health. Legislation,
				1929. No laws on the subject were passed during the year. Bills
				to amend the laws which prohibit contraceptive instruction were
				defeated in New York and Connecticut. </p>

			<head> Birth Control 1933 </head>
			<p>The general aim of the birth control movement is to legalize the
				practice of contraception through scientific and hygienic
				methods, and to educate the public to its advantages as a health
				and economic expedient. Though the movement had its origin in
				England, it was in 1914 in New York City that Mrs. Margaret
				Sanger first coined the term “birth control” and challenged the
				federal laws by advocating birth control on feministic and
				economic grounds. There followed in 1917 the publication of the
					<title>Birth Control Review</title>, the formation of the
				Voluntary Parenthood League in 1919, and the organization in
				1921 of the American Birth Control League. The period from 1914
				to 1921 was one of agitation, education, organization, and
				legislation. The National Committee on Maternal Health,
				organized in 1923, has for its purpose the scientific
				investigation of contraception, sterilization, and the general
				problems of sterility and fertility from the point of view of
				the practice of medicine and public health. In 1923 also the
				Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau was established in New
				York City. That Bureau-- with which a large number of social and
				welfare agencies and hospitals are cooperating has instructed
				over 31,000 women since its organization. The first 10,000 case
				histories, under a grant from the Bureau of Social Hygiene, have
				been analyzed by a committee of specialists and the results are
				to be made available at a later date.</p>

			<head type="sub">Legislative Campaigns, and Birth Control
				Clinics</head>
			<p>While efforts are being constantly made for needed legislation in
				the several states, the attention of leaders in the field has
				recently been centered more particularly upon obtaining federal
				legislation. For this purpose the <org>National Committee on
					Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org> was organized in
				1929. Federal laws forbidding the distribution of contraceptive
				information affect the use of the mails and common carriers, and
				impose a penalty of $5,000, or imprisonment for five years or
				both, on anyone who is convicted of a violation. In many states
				a physician may give oral contraceptive information to his
				patients, but scientific literature on the subject, or medical
				supplies for the purpose, cannot be legally sent to him through
				the United States mails, nor can he knowingly receive them
				without violating the law. Amendments to remedy this situation
				are now pending in Congress. At the present time not less than
				100 so-called birth control clinics- through some of them,
				located in hospitals, are not generally known as such- are
				operating legally in the United States (covering 43 cities in 17
				states). They are all places where contraceptive information may
				be obtained, but only under conditions within the limitation of
				the laws of each particular state. In New York State, for
				example, information can be given for the “cure or prevention of
				disease,” but not for economic reasons. In the Harlem section of
				New York City, through a grant from the <org>Julius Rosenwald
					Fund</org>, a branch clinic for colored women has been
				established as a part of the work of the Birth Control Clinical
				Research Bureau. A comprehensive study of the work and location
				of birth control clinics in different cities is contained in
				Seventy Birth Control Clinics (infra cit.), issued in 1930. The
				latest information as to the location of such clinics may be
				obtained from the National Committee on Maternal Health.</p>

			<head type="sub">The Movement Endorsed and Opposed</head>
			<p>In recent years public opinion has been rapidly growing in favor
				of medically supervised instruction on birth control, as
				evidenced by the support and endorsements given by medical and
				other groups since 1930. Conspicuous among the former were the
					<org>Public Health Relations Committee</org> of the <org>New
					York Academy of Medicine</org>. Its recommendations, adopted
				in 1931, included the following statement: <q who="PHRC">“A
					movement should be begun to include, in the curriculum of
					medical schools, instruction in modern contraceptive
					measures and in the indications therefor. The hospital
					clinics should likewise be asked to offer similar
					instruction to practicing physicians.” </q>At the White
				House Conference on Child Health and Protection in 1930 a
				similar recommendation was made by the Sub-committee of the
					<org>Section on Obstetric Teaching and Education of
					Physicians, Nurses, Midwives, Social Workers, and
					Laity</org>. Many religious groups have recently made public
				statement favorable to the birth control movement, at least to
				the extent of recognizing that existing laws should be modified
				which prevent physicians from imparting information concerning
				the use of contraceptives to those entitled to receive it. Among
				the groups which have issued such statements are the following:
				the <org> Committee on Marriage and the Home of the Federal
					Council of the Churches of Christ in America</org>;
					<org>General Council of the Congregational and Christian
					Churches</org>;<org> New York East Conference</org>,
					<org>Methodist Episcopal Church; Universalist General
					Convention</org>; and numerous political, lay, and social
				welfare organizations. In addition, the <org>Central Conference
					of American Rabbis </org>in 1929 urged <q who="CCAR">“the
					recognition of the importance of the control of parenthood
					as one of the methods of coping with social problems”</q>;
				and the <org>American Unitarian Association</org> in 1930
				recommended that its constituents consider the subject “to the
				end that they may support all reasonable efforts in their
				communities for the promotion of the birth control movement.”
				For the text of the statements by the specified organizations
				see Information Service (infra cit.) and <org>The Gospel and the
					Family and Youth</org> (General Council of the
				Congregational and Christian Churches), 1931. In July, 1930, the
					<org>English Ministry of Health</org> issued a memorandum
				stating that in response to a widespread responsible demand,
				public health authorities would be authorized to give birth
				control information in the maternal and infant welfare centers
				of which there are several thousand throughout the British
				Isles. This announcement was preceded by a favorable, though
				guarded, pronouncement by the House of Lords, the <org>Lambeth
					Conference of Bishops</org>, and the <org>British Medical
					Society</org>. The principal organized opposition to the
				movement comes from the Roman Catholic Church, and since the
				publication of the Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XI, <title>On
					Christian Marriage</title>, 1931, many Catholic
				organizations- including the National Council of Catholic Men,
				the <org>International Federation of Catholic Alumni</org>, and
				the <org>National Council of Catholic Women</org>- have
				registered formal protests against the passage of birth control
				legislation. It is safe to say that all Catholic organizations
				are similarly opposed. <org>The United Lutheran Church of
					America,</org>
				<org>Evangelical Lutheran Augusta Synod</org>, <org>Lord’s Day
					Alliance,</org> and a small number of local religious
				denominations are also reported as opposed to the pending birth
				control legislation. </p>
