		<head><emph rend="underline">Causes back of social problems</emph>.</head>
		<p>Two very apparent causes making for social problems of today. fear of too many &amp;
			heavy burden of increasing numbers</p>
		<p>Before and after marriage</p>
		<p>Fear causes</p>
		<list>
			<item>Prostitution 60,000 girls</item>
			<item>venereal diseases, 2,000,000 syphilitic</item>
			<item>coldness in wives--</item>
			<item>divorce</item>
		</list>
		<p>Increasing number</p>
		<list>
			<item>infant morality 300,000</item>
			<item>maternal ‘’ 15,000</item>
			<item>child labor 3,000,000</item>
			<item>abortion 1,000,000</item>
			<item>T.B. constantly ill. 500,000 </item>
			<item>T.B. school children die 2,000,000</item>
			<item>Labor problems--</item>
			<item>War--</item>
		</list>
		<p> All have roots in the increasing batallions of unwanted babies coming into a world whose
			system of society is not adequate to sustain 75% population in poverty ($1,000)</p>
		<p>Women bearing our future race from this stock---<person reg="Jukes Family">Jukes</person>
			and <person reg="Kallikak Family">Kallikak</person> families.</p>
		<p>Consequences of breeding from <emph rend="underline">stock lacking human vitality</emph>
			always will give us social problems and perpetuate institutions of charity and
			crime.</p>
		<p>Human life is cheap--too plentiful--<place reg="United States">U.S.A.</place>--Waste of
			human life appalling--1700 unnecessary deaths every day.</p>
		<p>Two classes society: small families &amp; large families</p>
		<p>One class spending time, energy of life <emph rend="underline">negative</emph> activities
			trying to alleviate conditions which if people had small families never would exist.
			Many <emph rend="underline">problems</emph> remain <emph rend="underline"
				>unsolved</emph>--<emph rend="underline">many questions still disputable</emph> but
			most of us are agreed that it is not to the welfare of society present or future--to
			bring to birth: feeble-minded, diseased, insane.</p>
		<p>Most of us will agree that having dispensed with bringing to birth diseased, feebleminded
			or insane. Neither is it to the welfare of the race to bring to birth children from
				<emph rend="underline">that class of society whose economic and eugenic standards
				are likely to produce the feebleminded, diseased and insane</emph>.</p>
		<p>Chain only as strong as its link. Mother weakest physically bearing burden of the
			race.</p>
