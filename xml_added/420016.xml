		<head>THE OLD AND THE NEW</head>
		<p><org>Blackwell's Island</org> reveals two striking illustrations of the woman of the past
			and the woman of the future.</p>
		<p><person reg="Davis, Katharine Bement">Katharine B. Davis</person> is the woman of the
			past and <person reg="Edelsohn, Rebecca">Rebecca Edelsohn</person> is the woman of the
			future.</p>
		<p>Katharine B. Davis was carefully trained in her youth for college; her college training
			helped and fortified her to become Police Matron of <org><place reg="Bedford Hills, NY"
					>Bedford </place>Reformatory for Women</org>, and subsequently Commissioner of
			Corrections of <place>New York</place>. Both worthy offices to uphold the present
			system.</p>
		<p>Katharine is a staunch defender of the present society, despite her experiences among
			"the fallen" and her knowledge that poverty and destitution has driven them to
			prostitution.</p>
		<p>Becky on the other hand comes from that race of people whose spirit has refused to be
			enslaved.</p>
		<p>Becky has never been to college but she knows more about existing conditions and their
			causes, about poverty, prostitution and their causes than Katharine learned in all her
			arduous years of college education. Becky considers such an calling as Police Matron as
			base and looks upon it with contemptuous scorn.</p>
		<p>Her ideals of womanhood are high. Her service to womankind is to free them.</p>
		<p>Katharine's position is to keep women in bondage. Becky's idea is to free all
			womankind.</p>
		<p>Katharine aims to keep women tame in submission to the chains of the present slavery.</p>
		<p>Becky aims to inspire them with revolt against the chains and the system which has
			enslaved them.</p>
		<p>In the background of these two women stands two greater forces which is a question of
			time when they too shall be in the death struggle similar to that taking place on <org
				reg="Blackwell's Island Penitentiary">Blackwell's Island</org>, Capital on Miss
			Davis' side and Labor on Becky Edelsohn's side.</p>
