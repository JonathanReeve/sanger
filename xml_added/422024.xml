		<head>Spreading Birth Control: A Woman's Activity</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>FOR the third time the <org>American Birth Control League</org> has had its booth at
				the <org reg="Women's Arts and Industries Exposition">Woman's Activities
					Exhibit</org> in <place reg="New York, NY">New York,</place> which was held this
				year in the ballroom of the <org>Hotel Astor</org> September 27th-October 1st.
				Exhibitors from many other booths came to congratulate the League on its
				advantageous position near one of the main entrances, and to get information about
				its work. As for visitors to the exhibit, though the faces of those who stopped or
				passed the booth by were new, the interest was the same as last year. Many of those
				who passed by turned as though arrested by something of great interest and looked
				back as if they fain would stop. Some did come back later, to find that interest in
				Birth Control was nothing to be ashamed of or afraid of.</p>
			<p>Of those who stopped, some were critics, others friends and still others people who
				wanted to know what Birth Control was or who wanted to have their doubts laid to
				rest by learning what it was not. With the latter <person reg="Cartere, Mrs.">Mrs.
					Cartere</person> and <person reg="Vandever, Martha R.">Mrs. Vandever,</person>
				who, with a changing group of helpers, had charge of the booth throughout the
				exhibit, were especially successful. After a talk with them it was a common thing to
				hear a vistor say <q who="UNK">"I did not know that was what Birth Control meant.
					That is very different. I certainly am for it."</q> Visitors who came to enquire
				were of all classes.</p>
			<p>Among those who were most eager to learn all there was to know about Birth Control
				were the people at the exhibit who represented the very poor, the doormen, the
				colored porters, the cleaning women-already parents of larger families than either
				health or pocketbook could properly support. A special effort was made to reach
				these and the effort was amply repaid by the close attention with which they
				listened and the look of relief and hope with which they accepted a card to the <org
					reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">Clinical Research
				Department.</org></p>
			<p>The <org>Continuation School</org> girls who came through in groups-girls forced
				through poverty to work so young that they must carry a certain amount of school
				work while employed-were also fertile soil.</p>
			<p>AMONG our critics were some Roman Catholics, but Roman Catholics were among our
				friends and supporters also. This was even more noticeable than at last year's
				exhibit, women stated they belonged to this <org reg="Roman Catholic Church"
					>church</org> came up, some in groups and some singly, to express appreciation
				of the work of the League. One of these was an Irishwoman, a house to house
				saleswoman of stockings, whose work took her to the doors of many crowded homes in
				city and country. "<q who="UNK">I believe our priests don't approve, but that does
					not influence me</q>," she said. "<q who="UNK">I never had no children so I
					don't need it myself, but I know many that does and I will do my bit to help the
					work along as I go from house to house</q>."</p>
			<p>A group of three Catholic women-one of them a teacher of feeble-minded children who
				held it a sin and a shame that these poor little souls should be thrust into a world
				they were not equipped to cope with-told many stories of the intolerances of their
				pastors and masters. One of these ladies had been a regular customer of <person
					reg="Marion, Kitty">Kitty Marion</person> ever since a priest told her of "<q
					who="UNK">a bold and brazen woman</q>" who sold the <title type="journal">BIRTH
					CONTROL REVIEW</title> on New York streets. Another owed her keen interest in
				the movement in large part to the intolerant and cruel reaction of her physician-a
				woman and a Catholic like herself-to the subject.</p>
			<p>What, she had asked her, of babies born only to die? "<q who="UNK">Let them be born
					to die</q>," answered the physician. But if the woman has heart disease? "<q
					who="UNK">Let her go through with it.</q>" Behind this modern doctor whose
				thought is still medieval one can almost see the shadow of <person
					reg="Luther, Martin">Martin Luther</person> and hear his reverberating voice
				dictate the words that will, in the minds of women at least, eternally stain his
				fame. "<q who="LUTMA">Let her only die in bearing. She is there to do it.</q>" The
					<org>Protestant church</org> he founded has outgrown this point of view and the
				testimony of some of these Catholics show that the laity in that church also is fast
				outgrowing it.</p>

			<head type="sub">SPREADING BIRTH CONTROL</head>
			<p>These were the new types at the Birth Control booth this year. Besides this there
				were all the old Social workers, nurses, doctors, college students and other
				broadminded men and women expressed hearty approval. On the other side were those
				who had "<q who="UNK">outgrown the need of Birth Control</q>" and who didn't see
				that others had not, those who were too squeamish to touch such a subject, those
				who, offhand on the basis of their own individual experience of spinsterhood or
				motherhood, condemned it.</p>
			<p>One of these brought a quick answer from Mrs. Vandever. Said she, as she looked back
				disdainfully in passing, "<q who="UNK">I am a <emph rend="italics"
				>mother</emph></q>" "<q who="VANMA">And some of us are grandmothers and
					great-grandmothers</q>," answered Mrs. Vandever, picking up the photograph of
				the presiding genius of the booth. This was the Birth Control great-grandchild-Birth
				Control because born when its mother wanted it and not by accident-of one of the
					<person reg="Unknown">strongest members of the board of directors</person> of
				the American Birth Control League.</p>
			<p>These are stories of individual visitors. As to numbers, some idea of how many were
				reached at the Woman's Activities Exhibit can be gained by the fact that 5,000
				pieces of literature were given, though an effort was made to give only to those who
				manifested a real interest.</p>
