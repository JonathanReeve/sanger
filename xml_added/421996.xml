		<head>HERE ARE THE FACTS</head>

		<p><q who="LNEWS">Labeling the Southwest as </q>"the most dangerous part
			of the United States in which to be born," <q who="LNEWS">Mrs.
				Margaret Sanger this week appealed to citizens of
					<place>Arizona</place>, <place>New Mexico</place>, and
					<place>Texas</place> to initiate community programs that
				will reduce the infant mortality rate in those three
			states.</q></p>
		<p>"Figures just released by the Children's Bureau of the U.S.
			Department of Labor show that while the infant mortality rate for
			the country as a whole was only 47 per thousand in 1940, the rate
			for New Mexico was 99.6 per thousand, for Arizona, 84 per thousand,
			and for Texas, 69 per thousand."</p>
		<p>"We who live in the Southwest should be ashamed to have the world
			know that it is twice to three times as dangerous for a baby to be
			born here as in <place>Minnesota</place>, <place>Oregon</place>, or
				<place>Connecticut</place>,"<q who="LNEWS"> Mrs. Sanger
				declared.</q></p>
		<p>"The shocking thing about the fact that as many as one in ten of our
			children die at birth or in the first year of life is that half to
			two-thirds of these deaths could be prevented.</p>
		<p> "An increased standard of living, made possible by increased incomes
			in the agricultural areas of the Southwest will, to some extent,
			help prevent some of these deaths. Extension of hospital and
			maternity center services to rural areas and to city slums will also
			help. Establishment of properly authorized and staffed clinics where
			mothers may get free information about planning their families is of
			basic importance." </p>
		<p>"There is no question but what the high infant death rate in some
			sections of the Southwest is due to the fact that the mothers who
			are least able to bear children have the most. Afflicted with
			tuberculosis or other disabling diseases, living in overcrowded
			homes, badly undernourished, they have neither the strength to bear
			a healthy child nor the means to give it decent care after it is
			born. Birth control information should be made available to these
			women, just as it is available to women who can afford to pay for
			the advice of a private physician," <q who="LNEWS">Mrs. Sanger
				said.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="LNEWS">Mrs. Sanger, for many years a winter resident of the
				Southwest, is honorary chairman of the <org>Planned Parenthood
					Federation of America</org>. Recognized as the founder of
				the birth control movement in the United States, she established
				the first birth control clinic in the <place>United
					States</place> twenty-five years ago. She has seen the work
				grow until there are now 612 birth control centers in the
				country. Although the movement encountered considerable
				opposition at the start it now has the support of leading
				religious, health, medical, and civic organizations. A recent
					<org>Gallup</org> poll indicated that 77% of the people of
				the United States favor the spread of birth control
				knowledge.</q>
