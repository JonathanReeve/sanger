		<head>Mrs. Sanger Aids Beverley </head>
		<p><q who="NYT">Margaret Sanger, head of the <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation
					for Birth Control</org>, at 17 West Sixteenth Street, made public yesterday a
				telegram sent to <person reg="Hoover, Herbert">President Hoover </person>protesting
				against the opposition of the <org>National Catholic Alumni Federation</org> to the
				advocacy by <person reg="Beverley, James R.">Governor James R. Beverley</person> of
					<place>Puerto Rico</place> of birth control for the natives of the island.</q>
			<q who="SANMA">“On behalf of the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
				Control," I wish to emphatically protest against the deliberate misstatements made
				by the National Catholic Alumni Federation reported in The <title type="journal">
					New York Times</title>,” her telegram said. </q>“Over 200 national and State
			organizations in medical, religious, social and educational fields have publicly
			endorsed the principles of birth control and are sponsoring the amendment of anti-birth
			control laws in this country. It is an arrogant interference on the part of any
			religious group to attempt to suppress the economic and social facts and to intimidate
			public officials who dare to present such facts when these are contrary to medieval
			theology.” </p>
