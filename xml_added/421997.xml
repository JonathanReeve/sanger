        <head>MRS. SANGER WAS GLAD SHE WAS INDICTED</head>
        <p>
            <q who="NYTR">A prima donna on a farewell tour could have justifiably envied the
                enthusiastic reception given Mrs. Margaret Sanger at the <org>Bandbox Theatr</org>e
                last evening.</q></p>
        <p><q who="NYTR">When the little woman, plainly garbed in a brown suit of corduroy, stepped
                to the front of the stage she was greeted with an outburst of applause which lasted
                ten minutes.</q></p>
        <p><q who="NYTR">The playhouse was jammed. Hundreds were refused admission, and what was to
                have been a meeting tendered to a martyr became a jubilee accorded a victor.</q></p>
        <p><q who="NYTR">Birth control was the topic of the evening, but this important subject was
                shelved at times for criticism of the Federal authorities, the unsympathetic public
                and the newspapers.</q></p>
        <p><q who="NYTR">Prosecution was called persecution, the newspapers were thanked for
                advertising, "The Little Rebel,"and Mrs. Sanger herself brought a burst of applause
                when she declared:</q> "You can no longer say the courts do not serve their purpose,
            for in helping to promote the fight for birth control they have more than served a
            purpose.</p>
        <p><q who="NYTR">Mrs. <person reg="Cothren, Marion B.">Marion B. Cothren</person>,
                presiding, introduced Mrs. Sanger as</q> "<q who="COTMA">the little woman who has
                taken the first big step in this country which will ultimately lift the ban on birth
                control</q>."</p>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Mrs. Sanger Says Publicity Will Aid.</head>
            <p>"Women want birth control in this country, and organized action will bring it about.
                Publicity will hasten it," said Mrs. Sanger.</p>
            <p>"When birth control leagues are established here we will soon resolve all social
                problems, such as mental defectiveness, deformity, settlement problems and child
                labor conditions. We will practically wipe out infant mortality. I have made a study
                of conditions abroad and have a message for you to-night." <place
                    reg="Holland, the Netherlands">Holland</place> has the lowest death rate of
                infants in the world. There they have fifty-seven clinics for teaching birth control
                in most densely populated districts."</p>
            <p>"In <place>France</place> conditions are just the opposite, and the infant mortality
                is the highest in the world, because the authorities and clergy have fought birth
                control. <place>England</place> is almost in the same condition. There is a greater
                need in this country for the work. The facilities and equipment are much better. We
                can outstrip all <place>Europe</place> in ten years if this matter is taken up. The
                trouble over here is that we are regulated by conventions."</p>
            <p>"Pardon me if I refuse to thank the government because I am now free and no longer a
                criminal. How kind of the government after a persecution of two years to tell the
                people of New York I am an orderly person. Two years ago I was branded."</p>
            <p>"Tonight I thank the grand jury for indicting me. I thank the Federal authorities for
                fanning the flame, and I thank the dear newspapers for publicity. They have done
                wonders to arouse interest in birth control."</p>
        </div>
        <div type="section">
            <head type="sub">Will Establish Clinics.</head>
            <p><q who="NYTR">Mrs. Sanger, who will leave in two weeks to establish clinics in
                    several Western cities, charged the government with "contemptible spying" into
                    her home, and said overtures were continually made to compromise the
                case.</q></p>
            <p>"Why, the <person reg="Marshall, H. Snowden">United States Attorney</person>," she
                declared, "declared to me that the birth control reading matter would be all right
                if written for an American magazine, but written in such direct, plain and simple
                language was too much for the <place>United States</place> mails."</p>
            <p>
                <q who="NYTR">The birth control movement has the hearty sanction of at least one New
                    York physician. Dr. <person reg="Goldwater, Abraham L.">A.L. Goldwater</person>,
                    brother of the former <person reg="Emerson, Haven">Health Commissioner,</person>
                    assailed brother members of his profession.</q></p>
            <p>"<q who="GOLAL">Half the physicians are opposed to birth control,</q>" he said, "<q
                    who="GOLAL">because it will cut down their incomes. This is a work the medical
                    profession should be identified with. I am pleased to give it my hearty
                    endorsement. It is unfortunate you have to defy the law to crystallize public
                    sentiment.</q>"</p>
            <p><q who="NYTR"><person reg="Goldman, Emma">Emma Goldman,</person> who will face trial
                    next Monday for alleged indiscreet utterances on birth control, lost an
                    opportunity to speak at the conclusion of the meeting. A sympathizer made an
                    eloquent plea for her, but when he glanced about she was not in the
                    audience.</q></p>
