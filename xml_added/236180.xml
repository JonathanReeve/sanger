			<head>BIRTH CONTROL THE CONCERN OF YOUTH</head>
			<head type="sub">Margaret Sanger addresses the Youth Conference</head>
			<p> There is no group more deeply concerned with birth control and all it can do for
				good and for ill than your generation, the men and women in their twenties, who will
				shape tomorrow’s world. I suppose you are a bit tired of hearing of your
				responsibility, and of how you will have to get the country out of the mess it is
				in. I suppose you often want to shout back at us: “Why did you tangle it all up? Why
				didn’t you manage better?”</p>
			<p>We <emph rend="underline">should</emph> have managed better, and it is up to us to do
				what we can to set things straight before we have to turn the whole affair over to
				you young people. It may make you less impatient with us to remember that we too
				have had to untangle confusion bequeathed to us by the generation that went before.
				We have been busy, up to our ears in work, trying to rectify mistakes not entirely
				of our own making.</p>
			<p>A mistake that has worked incalculable harm, and that I have spent the best years of
				my life trying to straighten out, was made by <person reg="Comstock, Anthony"
					>Anthony Comstock</person> in 1873, when the laws were passed prohibiting the
				sending of obscene literature through the mails. The overzealous Comstock made the
				tragic mistake of classing contraception with obscenity, and the result has been
				confusion worse confounded.</p>
			<p>As you perhaps know, the Committee of which I am the president, the <org>National
					Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org>, is seeking the
				amendment of these Federal laws. The amendments, ( Senate Bill 600 and House Bill
				5600) now before <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> would make it
				possible for doctors, hospitals and licensed clinics to secure contraceptive
				information.</p>
			<p>
				<person reg="Clarke, James Freeman">Someone</person> has said that the difference
				between a statesman and a politician is that the statesman thinks of the next
				generation and the politician thinks of the next election. By that definition I
				wonder how many statesmen we can claim to have in this country, in our present
				condition of relief and unemployment and misery, only to increase the population
				which increases poverty, unemployment and misery.</p>
			<p> Everyone knows that we are piling up enormous debts for future generations to pay.
				But it is not only financial or money debts that I am referring to--such debts may be
				easily cancelled–but it will not be so simple for future generations to wipe out of
				existence the debt of inferior racial qualities that we are passing down to them, or
				to wipe our a population with millions of morons and defectives which we are handing
				down for our children’s children to manage.</p>
			<p> You and your children will have to deal with these debts, with the results of the
				petty acts of politicians. You must put pressure on our lawmakers to legislate for
				the future, which belongs to you.</p>
			<p> Some sort of birth control is being practiced today, and will continue to be
				practiced. For birth control is here to stay. But which is better, you have a right
				to ask your elders, your parents, your teachers and you congressmen: Bootleg,
				uncertain and often harmful methods, promoted by commercial firms for profit, or
				scientific, harmless, efficient methods prescribed by physicians for the best
				interest of you and your children?</p>
			<p> The political problems of today are the unsolved social and economic questions of
				yesterday. We are trying to face them. The social and economic needs of today will
				be the political problems of tomorrow. These are for you to face.</p>
			<p>
				<list>
					<item>Ten Truths about Birth Control</item>
					<item>1. Birth controllers are divided into two groups, the largest group are
						those who want knowledge for themselves; another, though smaller group, is
						those civic minded people who wish to see birth control used, for health and
						economic reasons by those who need it.</item>
					<item>2. Only a very small percentage of people who practice birth control are
						perfectly satisfied with present day methods.</item>
					<item>3. Research and the development of better methods are retarded by existing
						restrictive laws.</item>
					<item>4. These laws, which have been on the Federal Statute books since 1873,
						still class prevention of conception with abortion and obscenity.</item>
					<item> 5. Neither physicians, hospitals, nor medical books are exempt under this
						law, and violations provide a penalty of five thousand dollars fine or five
						years in prison or both. </item>
					<item>6. The law, however, is unenforceable because there are thousands of
						articles and drugs, that prevent conception and which may, at the same time,
						be used for the prevention of disease.</item>
					<item>7. This situation has given rise to bootleg manufacture and distribution
						of contraceptives and has placed the matter in the hands of commercial firms
						operating for profit rather than of physicians working for the public good. </item>
					<item>8. If the <name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Criminal
							Code</name> were amended, scientific birth control instruction could be
						included in the public health program of the <org
							reg="United States Government">Federal Government</org>, and physicians,
						hospitals and clinics could secure supplies legally and give
						information.</item>
					<item>9. The knowledge of how to control the coming of children is necessary for
						happy marriage.</item>
					<item>10. The youth of <place reg="United States">America</place> should demand
						this knowledge.</item>
				</list></p>

			<p> As a result of the Comstock laws, birth control instead of being recognized for what
				it really is, a fine, constructive thing, necessary for health and happiness, has
				been besmirched and driven underground. Here is medical information, which should be
				prescribed by physicians. Leading medical supply houses should be putting their best
				talent to work in order that we might have ever better and ever less expensive
				contraceptive supplies. Instead, up to the present time, birth control supplies are
				a bootleg product, and their manufacture and sale does not come under the regulation
				of any government agency.</p>
			<p>What concern is all this of Youth? As the just married, or about-to-be-married
				couples of today, as the mothers and fathers of the future, I think that you, more
				than any other group should understand the present situation. Many young people
				would marry today, and have all the joys that should rightly come to young
				people--the start in life, the companionship, the chance to make of marriage a fine
				and constructive force--if they could feel certain that they could postpone founding
				a family without harm to themselves or to their future children. Many a girl would
				follow her natural inclination and marry, if she did not fear the coming of
				childbearing and baby tending before she was ready for them. The early months and
				years of marriage should be a time of adjustment between a young man and woman. They
				should learn to know each other first as comrades and human beings before assuming
				the role of parents. </p>
			<p>Many outstanding organizations of and for young people have taken a stand on birth
				control. The <org reg="Young Men's Christian Association">Y.M.C.A.</org> at its
				biennial convention last May, adopted a resolution in favor of “<q who="YMCA">social
					legislation such as measures which will provide that the dissemination of birth
					control information shall be placed under authorized medical direction.</q>”
				Many local <org>Junior League</org>s have endorsed birth control and the Junior
				League magazine has run several articles on the subject. The <org>National
					Conference of Allied Youth</org>, sponsored by <org reg="Boy Scouts of America"
					>Boy Scouts</org>, <org reg="Girl Scouts of America">Girl Scouts</org>,
					<org>Camp Fire Girls</org>, YMCA and <org
					reg="Young Women's Christian Association">YWCA</org>, and other youth
				organizations, faced the issues squarely at its Youth Today dinner last fall. Should
				young couples have children when they had no assurance of the child’s future, they
				queried? Why is it not possible to obtain birth control information safely and
				legally and decently?</p>
			<p> Among the many letters that come to me, I received one the other day from a young
				man who wrote: “<q who="UNK">I am thinking of getting married, and am not in a
					position to have children. I know there are dozens of preparations on the
					market, supposed to be alright. The question I am asking you is what is the
					safest and the best way to prevent children until I am able to care for them. I
					asked my doctor about this, and he went into a tirade about the fall of
						<place>Greece</place> and <place reg="Rome, Italy">Rome</place>, and gave me
					a lot of generalities which told me nothing.</q>”</p>
			<p>You have a right to ask of us, the older generation, about these things. And it is
				our duty to give you, not a lot of generalities about Greece and Rome, but the
				scientific and helpful truth.” </p>
