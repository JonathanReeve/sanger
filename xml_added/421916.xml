		<head>Birth Control Committee Disbands, Victorious</head>
		<p>
			<q who="U">The work of the <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
					Control</org> is done and well done, the organization is therefore dissolved,
				Margaret Sanger, president, announced in an editorial in the current issue of her
				magazine, The <title type="journal">National Birth Control News</title>. Hailing the
				action of the <org reg="American Medical Association">American Medical
					Association</org>as strengthening the cause of birth control, already victorious
				through the clarification of the Federal Comstock statute, Mrs. Sanger disclosed
				that her Committee has been formally dissolved by unanimous action of its Board of
				Directors. The Resolution embodying this action reads:</q>
		</p>
		<p>“Whereas the purposes of the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control,
			Inc., have been accomplished, in the light of the recent decision by the <org
				reg="United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit">Circuit Court of
				Appeals</org>,</p>
		<p>“Be it Resolved that the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control,
			Inc., be dissolved...” </p>
		<p>
			<q who="U">Her own education as a trained nurse made her see more than twenty years ago
				that birth control was a medical and technical problem, over and above everything
				else, said Mrs. Sanger.</q>
		</p>
		<p>“This has been my steadfast policy,” <q who="U">she continued.</q> “We have fought for
			medically directed clinics, for medical support and for medical endorsement and
			recognition. Time and again members of the profession, even those in high standing, have
			told us that we could never win. But individual support grew. Organized support grew.
			Today we can feel that the same principles of right have won.” </p>
		<p>
			<q who="U"><org>The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</org> handed
				down a decision in a test case on November 30, 1936, stating that the design of the
				Federal Comstock statute “was not to prevent the importation, sale or carriage by
				mail of things which might intelligently be employed by conscientious and competent
				physicians for the purpose of saving life or promoting the well being of their
				patients.” Thus Mrs. Sanger won her fight for an amendment to the statute exempting
				physicians from its restrictions.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="U">The American Medical Association at its annual Convention in <place
					reg="Atlantic City, NJ">Atlantic City</place>unanimously adopted the
				report of its <org>Committee to Study Contraceptive Practices</org>, by action of
				its <org>House of Delegates</org> on June 8th. The Committee recommended the
				teaching of contraception in medical schools, the investigation of materials,
				devices and methods, and the clarification of physicians of their legal rights in
				relation to the use of contraceptives.</q>
		</p>
		<p>“Now comes the future, full of hope and challenge,” <q who="U">says Mrs. Sanger.</q> “The
			impetus of the work is doubly renewed. We can now consolidate the gains we have made,
			and move steadily forward in a larger program of national and international scope.” <q
				who="U">The educational work of the birth control movement will be carried on by the
					<org>Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau of New York</org>, of which Mrs.
				Sanger is the director. </q></p>
