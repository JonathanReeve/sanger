		<head>Mrs. Sanger's Opinion</head>
		<p> To the Editor of the <title type="journal">New York Times</title></p>
		<p>In your editorial this morning, Nov. 15, you criticize the action of the birth control
			advocates who were arrested Sunday night at the <org reg="Town Hall">Town Hall</org> for
			not obeying the police when they told them to leave the hall. You further state that
			there is a legal way to adjust these matters, and that one has redress in the
			courts.</p>
		<p> Do you realize in making such statements that they are inconsistent with the facts of
			the case? Do you realize that the <person reg="Gaine, Thomas">officer</person> who
			placed me under arrest had absolutely no right or reason to enter that hall and to
			prohibit my addressing an audience? This was verified by the dismissal f the case before
			the <person reg="Corrigan, Joseph E."> Judge</person> the following morning.</p>
		<p> Had I left the hall in obedience to the deputy command. I would have had nothing upon
			which to go into the courts for a decision. It was necessary for the deputy to make an
			arrest in order to get a right interpretation of the law in this case.</p>
		<p> I think your criticism of our meeting was very unjust and does not stand at all for the
			principle of right which is the essential thing that this <org
				reg="United States Government">Government </org> is based upon.</p>
