		<p>NEWSPAPERS and periodicals have been full of reviews of the various happenings of 1927.
			But no review of the past year is completel which does not take note of the tremendous
			growth of the movement towards Birth Control. After a long struggle, at the beginning of
			which the advocates of Birth Control were voices crying in the wilderness and finding
			few to listen, Birth Control seems now to be taking the place in the minds of men to
			which its importance entitles it. Gradually the idea began to penetrate and Birth
			Control found supporters among scientists and thinkers. The new aspect of the movement
			is that writers on social questions questions now do not seem to think it necessary to
			argue the question. They simply take Birth Control for granted, as part of the basis on
			which any better social structure must be built. Such is the attitude of <person
				reg="Smith, Thomas Vernor">Thomas Vernor Smith,</person> in <title type="book">"The
				Democratic Way of Life"</title> and of <person reg="Huntington, Ellsworth"
				>Huntington</person> and <person reg="Whitney, Leon Fradley">Whitney</person> in
				<title type="book">"The Builders of America."</title>
			<person reg="Ross, Edward Alsworth">Professor E. A. Ross</person> makes a more definite
			appeal for Birth Control in <title type="book">"Standing Room Only",</title> but one
			could cite book after book, among those recently published, where Birth Control is
			accepted as essential, rather than advocated as a reform. Many magazines and periodicals
			have opened their pages to articles and letters giving the pros and cons on Birth
			Control or announcing it as the subject of an Open Forum. Among the events of 1927 also
			must be recorded the great English debate held by the <org reg="Cambridge Union Society"
				>Cambridge Union</org> when Birth Control, after a magnificent forensic display, was
			approved by a vote of 512 to 315.</p>
		<p>MORE significant than lay opinion, is it that in 1927 there was a distinct awakening in
			the medical profession to the importance of Birth Control. The profession is being urged
			by some of the more far-sighted of its own members to "<q who="UNK">stop driving the
				subject of Birth Control to propaganda organizations, and try ourselves to regulate
				control of conception,"</q> an admonition which was lacking until the propaganda
			organizations had beaten a path along which the medical profession could advance with
			ease and comfort. The way of the doctor was made easier in 1927 by the Report made by
			the <org reg="United Kingdom National Council of Public Morals">Special Committee to the
				National Council of Public Morals,</org> which was published in <place
				reg="London, England">London</place> in November. This Committee recorded its
			opinion that <q who="NCPM">"no impediment should be placed in the way of married couples
				who desired information as to contraceptives, when this was needed for medicals
				reasons, or because of excessive child-bearing poverty."</q> It also recommended the
			giving of such information by medical practitioners and at hospitals. The time seems to
			be speedily coming when the medical profession, forgetting its long reluctance, will
			unhesitatingly claim contraception as a ncessary part of medical practice. They will not
			be allowed the whole field without protests from the Economists, who were out in favor
			of Birth Control while the doctors, in general, were still hesitant. It is worth noting
			in this review of progress in 1927 that Birth Control and its Relation to the Food
			Supply was one of the questions suggested for those who wished to compete for the
			Thousand Dollar Economic prize, offered for the 24th time, through the generosity of
				<org reg="Hart Schaffner &amp; Marx">Hart Schaffner and Marx</org> of <place
				reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago,</place> and supervised by the Committee of which <person
				reg="Laughlin, James Lawrence">J. Lawrence Laughlin</person> of the <org>University
				of Chicago</org> is chairman.</p>
		<p>THE recent <org reg="National Conference on Race Betterment, 3rd">Race Betterment
				Conference,</org> held at <place reg="Battle Creek, MI">Battle Creek,
				Michigan,</place> January 2-6, is an example of the universal acceptance of Birth
			Control. We have no story of the Conference to publish in the <title type="journal"
				>BIRTH CONTROL REVIEW</title> this month. The reason is that, from the official
			program, Birth Control--the cornerstone of the arch of race betterment--was omitted. But
			we have the evidence of <person reg="Knopf, S. Adolphus">Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf,</person>
			who was refused the privilege of speaking on this subject but requested to speak there
			on tuberculosis, that Birth Control was present unofficially throughout the sessions. A
			good three-quarters of the speakers, he states, made it part of their program. And what
			brought it home to those at the conference who may not have given it much thought before
			was the statistics, graphically exhibited by electric time signals, of the <org
				reg="American Eugenics Society">American Eugenics society.</org> We have given these
			before in the <title type="journal">BIRTH CONTROL REVIEW</title>, but they should be
			learned by heart.<q who="AES">"Every second,"</q> said the lights, "<q who="AES">crime
				costs America $100,000, every 15 seconds $100,000 go for the care of persons with
				bad heredity, such as insane, feeble-minded, and other defectives. Every 16 seconds
				a person is born in the <place>United States,</place> every 7 1/2 minutes a
				high-grade person is born in the United States who will have ability to do creative
				work and be fit for leadership. About 4 percent of all American citizens come within
				this class. Every 48 seconds a person is born who will never grow up mentally beyond
				the age of a normal 8 year old child, every 50 seconds a person is committed to jail
				in the United States. Very few normal persons go to jail."</q>There is no true
			Eugenics-no practical Race Betterment-that does not have Birth Control as its base.</p>
		<p>THE price society pays for crime in money is only part of what it pays. The whole price,
			the perverted curiosity and perverted sympathy a shocking crime may arouse, is a far
			heavier one. The melodrama of the <person reg="Snyder, Ruth">Snyder</person> case has
			come to an end, but its effects are not over. Personalities like Ruth Snyder and <person
				reg="Gray, Judd">Judd Gray</person> are the true unfit, their influence is even more
			fateful than their crime and the evidence they furnish of the morbid instincts to which
			the crowd responds calls for eugenic action. So far is the newspaper reading public
			debased that it went to Ruth Snyder for an opinion on Birth Control. Just after her
			conviction the papers published an attack by her in which she said that a houseful of
			children would have saved her from sin. The bankruptcy of the opposition is shown by the
			character of this witness they bring forward. The Snyder case is a most convincing
			argument for Birth Control. Ruth Snyder should never have had any children. The child
			Mrs. Snyder left behind is far the most pitiable figure in the drama, but we can at
			least be thankful that she had only one. For children are forced not only to bear the
			stigma before the world but the inner stigmata of a bad inheritance.</p>
		<p>Not the smallest evidence of the need for Birth Control eugenics is the evidence this
			case presents that even the decent instincts of the public are crookedly applied. It is
			inexcusable crimes such as this which stimulate opposition to capital punishment. This
			is unjust, for as long as a campaign against capital punishment is associated with such
			cases, decent and thoughtful people will be antagonized. When Birth Control has cut down
			the huge proportions of the problem of unfitness, when humanity, furnished with a normal
			inheritance and a normal and ample environment itself grows normal, capital punishment
			will, with very little agitation, become an institution of the dark past.</p>
