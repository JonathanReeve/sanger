		<head>Problems of Population and Parenthood: A Review by Margaret Sanger</head>
		<p>The "<title type="book">Problems of Population and Parenthood</title>" is the second
			report of the <org rend="underline" reg="United Kingdom National Birth-Rate Commission"
				>British National Birth-rate Commission</org>, 1918-1920. It is an exhaustive tome
			consisting of many hundreds of pages and is divided into two parts: the evidence taken
			for and against the control of Parenthood; and the findings of the Commission. To the
			cursory reader this is a splendid-looking effort toward a (solution) or one of the
			fundamental problems of the human race. Upon closer examination, however, we find two
			interesting facts that rather take away some of the value. In the first place, this
			Commission is <emph rend="underline">self-appointed.</emph> One would imagine that
				<del>if</del>this Commission had <del>not</del> been appointed by the <org
				reg="United Kingdom Government">British Government</org>, <del>
				<unclear>at least it</unclear>
			</del>and operated and functioned under <del>some indirect</del><add>direct</add>
			sanction of official interest. <del>But such is not the case.</del> The people involved
			gathered together under this <del>distinctly Anglo-Saxon</del>title on their own
			initiative. Even if <del>there</del>
			<add>this</add> were so, we might not object were it not for the second weakness: among
			the forty-<del>one</del> members of the Commission ten are clergymen; eight are medical
			men; <del>only</del> two <del>are</del> biologists; <del>thirteen</del>
			<del>and</del>twelve are women <add>whose interests are social-reform work;</add>the
			balance being laymen of varying import. Naturally the findings of such a self-appointed
			group <del>of enthusiasts</del>must be retrograde and reactionary. It is a curious
			example of the credibility of mankind that it accepts the opinions of unscientific minds
			upon purely scientific subjects!</p>
		<p>The deeper we go into this massive book, the more amazed we become. The witnesses called
			before the Commission represent some of the most vital levels of thought in
				<place>England</place>, and <place reg="United States">America</place>. Among the
			host we find <person reg="Webb, Sidney">Sidney Webb</person>, <add>Judge <person
					reg="Neil, Henry">Neil</person> and</add>, Judge <person
				reg="Lindsey, Benjamin Barr">Lindsey</person>
			<add>of U.S.A</add> Sir <person reg="Doyle, Arthur Conan">Arthur Conan Doyle</person>,
			Sir <person reg="Osler, William">William Osler</person>, Dr. <person
				reg="Stopes, Marie C.">Marie Stopes</person>, Sir <person reg="Haggard, H. Rider"
				>Rider Haggard</person>, Mr. <person reg="Cox, Harold">Harold Cox</person> the
			editor of the <title type="journal">Edinburgh Review</title>, <add>Mrs. <person
					reg="Booth, Evangeline">Booth</person>
				<org>Salvation Army</org></add>, <person reg="Lloyd-George, William">W. L.
				George</person>, and many, many others.<del>What a hodge-podge of individuals. The
				list of witnesses almost reads as though the Commission had put alot of names in a
				hat and chosen them blindfolded, not and again luckily finding a significant
				individual.</del></p>
		<p>Yet even with this, the hopeful student might seek to find real good in <emph
				rend="underline">any</emph> effort to solve the problem. Unfortunately, every page
			but adds to the conclusions already listed. Many problems are taken up, but the
			essential one concerning the population question and the fall of the birth rate and its
			effect upon the country was <del>not convincing</del>
			<add>neither thorough nor convincing</add> Having proved <add>what is already
				known</add> that the birth rate <emph rend="underline">had fallen</emph> in England
			they next proceed to <del>reluctantly</del>discuss the <emph rend="underline"
				>causes</emph>. These are classified under infant mortality, venereal diseases and
			birth control. Much of the evidence taken deals with the classification of the causes of
			infant mortality, and a large proportion is found to be due to the infection of infants
			by parents with venereal diseases! On this subject much valuable evidence was given by
			Sir William Osler and Sir <person reg="Donkin, Bryan">Bryan Donkin</person>. They
			pointed out that if these diseases are to be checked they must be dealt with as diseases
			and the moral consideration entirely eliminated. If everyone could be persuaded to live
			clean lives the problem would be solved, but in the meanwhile as this conduct seems
			impossible for all people we cannot adopt measures to prevent the disease and at the
			same time retain the risk of incurring them as a deterrent to immorality. And the
			findings of the Commission resulted in a whitewashing of the prevalent system which
			permits the cure of venereal diseases, but provides no adequate method to prevent
			them!</p>
		<p>The evidence taken on birth control was particularly interesting. It was pointed out that
			the conscious use of artificial methods to prevent conception were employed by the
			better classes, upper middle and artisan classes, while the population is recruited from
			the lower or unfit! The question of the use of these methods, and how far they are
			injurious to health seemed to be the bone of contention. Dr. Marie Stopes made an
			excellent report and as she is <del>one of the greatest living</del><add>an able</add>
			biologist <add>having made a special study of birth control</add> her testimony and
			experiences are valuable. Harold Cox's testimony was also intelligent and far-reaching.
			The only suggestion given by various other witnesses was such as to invite the
			production of still greater <del>hords</del> hordes of <del>the unfit</del><add>unwanted
				progeny</add>. No suggestions were given to stop the production of the unfit or
			diseased, or feeble minded. There was some talk of the motherhood pension system--in
			other words the placing of a premium on motherhood, rather than the control of the
			unfit. One suggestion was immigration to the Colonies, as if these parts of the world
			desired their ranks to be recruited by the feeble minded, the physical and mentally
			unfit, etc. One witness carried on the idea, or maybe more, that the Empire should have
			a greater volume of population in order to hold its preeminent position in the sun. In
			other words, as someone recently said: <add>The Commission asked the women of England
				to</add> enter into a "<q who="UKNBC">cradle competition to save the
			Empire</q>."</p>
		<p>Need it be said that the conclusions of this Commission are worthless? They merely
				<del>carry on</del><add>sanction</add> what is in existence to-day and put the seal
			of approval on the unscientic control of birth and population. The interested reader
			will do well to read the various resolutions made by different groups on the subject of
			voluntary restriction of the birth rate. (See pages clxii-clxvi). It is unfortunate that
			we are unable to treat this section at length because of the limits of space. The
			Commission condemned <add>the practice of</add> birth control.</p>
		<p>Dr. Marie Stopes objected to the grounds upon which this decision was predicated and
			addressed a letter to each signer of the Reservation against birth control: "<q
				who="STOMA">As possibly you are aware, I consider that the question of the right use
				of sound hygienic methods of Birth Control as one of the very greatest
				importance.</q>" She goes on to say that she noticed that this particular member had
			signed the reservation against birth control:"<q who="STOMA">Had the grounds of your
				objection been stated to be a religious or moral conviction, I should,
					<del>have</del>
				<add>of</add> course, have had <add>no</add> more to say, but you state above you
				signature that you base your condemnation of all scientific methods of control on
				'medical evidence</q>."</p>
		<p>Dr. Stopes inclosed a self-addressed and stamped envelope for reply and a ready-prepared
			slip. In their replies not one quoted a page of the report containing medical evidence.
			In fact, there is not a line of reliable evidence throughout the report which would
			substantiate the decision against birth control. It is only one of the glaring
			weaknesses and ill-devised work of this self-appointed body of <del>enthusiasts</del>
			<add>non-experts</add>.</p>
		<p>One sentence in the report seems to me to give the key to the Commission's entire state
			of mind: "<q who="UKNBC">It is for the women of the Empire to save the Empire by
				securing its continuance for the fulfilment of its beneficent mission in the
				world</q>." </p>
