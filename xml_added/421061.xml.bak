		<head>Says Men More Interested In Birth Control Program</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Men, in organized groups, have taken a greater interest in birth
					control than women in the same status, it was declared today by Mrs. Margaret
					Sanger, nationally known birth control advocate, who spoke at the <org
						reg="El Paso Altrusa Club">Altrusa Club</org>luncheon on “Family
					Security.”</q>
			</p>
			<p>“Men seem to realize its social importance with reference to relief and
				unemployment,” <q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “Women are interested as
				individuals but after they find out information, they are through being interested.” </p>
			<p><q who="EPHP">And this link must be straightened in the chain of effort to obtain a
					big hook-up between welfare agencies and birth control clinics throughout the
					country, Mrs. Sanger maintains. It will be necessary to get the support of not
					only women's organizations but of every welfare agency and organization in every
					community to obtain the passage of the federal bill which will allow legal
					dissemination of birth control information and automatically open up 10,000
					hospitals in the <place>United States</place> to persons who most need that
					information--those on relief, she says.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Population Great</head>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Statistics showing the decline of the birth rate doesn’t mean
					anything, because the population is greater, Mrs. Sanger said.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“Remember, there was a 17-million population increase from 1920 to 1930,” <q
					who="EPHP">she said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">She quoted 1932 statistics given at the <org>American Conference on
						Birth Control and National Recovery</org> in <place reg="Washington, DC"
						>Washington</place>by <person reg="Sydenstricker, Edgar">Edgar
						Sydenstricker</person>.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“The average annual birth rate in families on relief was 53 per cent higher than in
				those not on relief,” <q who="EPHP">she said.</q> “The birth rate in families which
				were receiving relief in 1932 was 210 as against 137 in families which were not
				receiving relief, a survey in four cities revealed."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger does not blame the families on relief, but the authorities
					and organizations in every community, she said.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“They won’t take a stand to enable these people to get the information they should
				have,” <q who="EPHP">she said.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Blames Representative</head>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">She also blames <person reg="Sumners, Hatton W.">Rep. Hatton
						Sumners</person>, chairman of the <org
						reg="United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee">House
						Judiciary committee</org>, for keeping the Birth Control Bill in the
					committee last year.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“<person reg="Ashurst, Henry Fountain">Senator Ashurst</person> of <place
					reg="Phoenix, AZ">Phoenix</place>, chairman of <org
					reg="United States Senate Judiciary Committee">Judiciary of the Senate</org>,
				allowed the bill to reach the <org reg="United States Senate">senate</org>,” <q
					who="EPHP">she said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger expects a fight against establishing a birth control
					clinic in <place reg="Dallas, TX">Dallas</place>, Representative Sumner’s home.
					She will go to <place reg="Ft. Worth, TX">Ft. Worth</place>and Dallas after
					leaving here.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“But I believe the people in Dallas will put up a good fight for the clinic,”<q
					who="EPHP">she said</q> “Such a clinic was established in six weeks’ time in
					<place reg="Tucson, AZ">Tucson</place>.”</p>
			<p>“A business man paid a year’s rent for a cottage as headquarters. Co-operation is
				being given by the <org reg="Pima County Medical Society">County Medical
					society</org> and welfare agencies.”</p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger will confer with a group of El Paso men and women this
					afternoon on the establishment of a clinic here.</q>

			<head type="sub">Mrs. Sanger Meets at Luncheon with El Paso Doctors.</head>
			<p><supplied resp="MSPP">Portions of this article that do not describe this speech have
					been omitted.</supplied></p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Conscious control of the birth rate was stressed as the most important
					factor aimed for by the <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
						Control</org>, Mrs. Sanger said at the Altrusa Club luncheon yesterday.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“We control everything nowadays except the most important thing of all,” <q
					who="EPHP">she said</q>. “We control our tempers, our appetites, our currency.
				But we allow the increase of children who cannot be given a chance at life, in homes
				which can not afford them, do not want them. And we carry the burden in our social
				program.”</p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">No intelligence is being shown in the relief work, in any work for
					charity when children of unfit parents, or poverty-stricken parents are brought
					into the world in an increasing number, Mrs. Sanger pointed out.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“It is like trying to cure the cancer by burning it on top,” <q who="EPHP">she
					said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">The average cost to maintain a person through the birth control clinic
					would be $2 a year, Mrs. Sanger said.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“Would you like to have knowledge?”<q who="EPHP"> is the question asked women at
					clinics.</q></p>
			<p>“It is taking the information out of the pornographic class and giving it out from
				scientific centers which take care of the individual needs of the women,”<q
					who="EPHP"> Mrs. Sanger said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">She said that 51,000 women had been taken care of in her own New York
					Clinic, for which she served 30 days in jail.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“I never spent a better 30 days in my life,”<q who="EPHP">she said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">In advocating young couples’ waiting two years after marriage to have
					children, Mrs. Sanger said:</q>
			</p>
			<p>“We have got to make more of marriage. We have never had the development of the
				woman. The boy never knows the girl as a woman. He knows her as a girl and next as
				mother of children.</p>
			<p>“The wife never knows herself as a woman. She never gets the spiritual and mental
				development which should be hers between girlhood and motherhood.”</p>
			<p>“There are 47 states with conflicting laws on birth control,” <q who="EPHP">Mrs.
					Sanger said. <place>California</place>bootlegs her supplies to take care of her
					14 clinics under her own law, she said.</q></p>
