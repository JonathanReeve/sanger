			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Clinical birth control methods are approaching 100 per cent success;
					but cheaper, easier and equally harmless means must be found to help the
					millions to whom present methods are economically or geographically unavailable,
					Mrs. Margaret Sanger, director of the <org>Birth Control Clinical Research
						Bureau</org>, declared yesterday.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">She spoke at the opening of a two-day conference on control research
					and clinical practice at the Hotel Roosevelt. More than 200 persons, many of
					them physicians, representing about fifty clinics in all parts of the country,
					heard papers describing several methods in the experimental stage which, if
					perfected, may revolutionize birth control practices.</q>

			<head type="sub"> Bureau’s Work Reviewed</head>
			<p> “The outstanding achievement of this bureau,” <q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said</q>,
				“has been to inform, teach, instruct and give contraceptive advice to more than
				56,000 women who voluntarily appealed to us for this advice. The records of these
				women may truly be looked upon as a veritable human laboratory for research and
				correlations. </p>
			<p> “We have been fortunate in enlisting the cooperation of competent physicians and
				have amassed a wealth of incontrovertible evidence supporting the feasibility and
				desirability of contraceptive practice. The evidence seems to be on our side, for in
				all the studies we have made we find, when our teachings are followed and adhered
				to, there is the record of 96.4 to 97 per cent success. </p>
			<p> “The birth-control movement has arrived at a stage in its development where it
				definitely can help that part of the population accessible to hospitals, doctors or
				in the health services where properly qualified doctors are available, but we must
				go further and supply the demand of women in the submerged sections who are
				clamoring for cheap and effective means to control the size of the family. </p>
			<p> “We must have methods that are cheaper, easier to apply and as harmless as those
				which we now use have proven to be. The scientist must come to our aid. We want his
				cooperation, his wisdom, his impersonal courage and vision.”</p>

			<head type="sub"> Praises Recent Court Verdict</head>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger praised a <name
						reg="United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries">recent
						decision</name> of the <org>United States Circuit Court of Appeals</org>,
					which held that</q> “the Federal statutes were not designed to obstruct the
				circulation of articles which may be intelligently employed by conscientious
				physicians for the purpose of saving life and promoting well-being.” </p>
			<p> “In our effort to clear away this legal rubbish,” <q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger
				added</q>, “we have uncovered many obstacles, but we cannot go much farther, either
				onward or upward, without the help of the scientific mind.” </p>
