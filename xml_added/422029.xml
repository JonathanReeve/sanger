		<head>EDITORIAL COMMENT</head>
		<p>IF ANY SUBSCRIBERS to <title type="journal">THE BIRTH CONTROL REVIEW</title> failed to
			receive the August number of the magazine, we wish them to know that it was because that
			issue was ordered barred from the mails by the authorities in <place
				reg="Washington, DC">Washington.</place> The reason given was, that we had printed a
			review and an advertisement of an important book which had been enthusiastically
			received in the <place reg="Great Britain">British Empire,</place> but which was
			declared to be unmailable here. Our readers know that we have been exceedingly careful
			to keep within the letter and the spirit of postal regulations. We did not propose to
			give reactionary minds in officialdom an opportunity to interfere with the work for
			woman's freedom to which this publication is devoted. At last, however, a cause has been
			found. Our answer to this attack, as to all others, is to be propaganda of the most
			effective kind. It will be the only answer intelligible to the type of official who is
			seeking to hamper the birth control movement. In the future, as in the past, we shall
			not intentionally violate postal regulations. But, by means of a bigger, broader, still
			more fearless magazine, we shall combat the spirit which led to the assault upon us. To
			that end we have asked our subscribers to co-operate with us in trebling the REVIEW's
			circulation. We intend to deal telling blows at the dark superstitions which perpetuate
			in <place reg="United States">America</place> the lust of witch burning. Those who read
			the leading article in the suppressed number know what difficulties have been overcome
			in bringing out the first twelve issues of <title type="journal">THE BIRTH CONTROL
				REVIEW</title>. Said difficulties did not deter those who have made the publication
			a power for free womanhood. The barring of an edition from the mails, far from
			discouraging us, has moved us to new efforts. But it is possible that this first
			interference with the <title type="journal">REVIEW</title> may have more significance
			than now appears to be the case. The powers of reaction have recently taken away many of
			the reforms that American women have won in fifty years of toil, hardship and sacrifice.
			Yesterday, the Federal child labor legislation, such as it was, went to the scrap heap.
			Tomorrow, the attack may be wider in its scope. As for the advocates of birth control,
			they intend to battle in the first ditch, not the last one. With all that we have of
			inspiration, courage and resource, we shall hold fast to what we have gained. We shall
			not let up in our fight on the medieval in tolerance, which makes it possible to deny
			the mails of this country to a message of woman's freedom.</p>
		<p>THE <person reg="Hylan, John Francis">MAYOR</person> of <org
				reg="New York Committee on Women on National Defense"><place reg="New York, NY">New
					York's</place> Committee of Women on National Defense,</org> the <org
				reg="New York City Department of Health, Division of Child Hygiene">Division of
				Child Hygiene</org> of the same city's <org reg="New York City Department of Health"
				>Department of Health,</org> the <org>New York Milk Committee</org> and similar
			agencies have united in a "save 100,000 babies" campaign. One child in every seven born
			in the United States dies from malnutrition or from some disease directly traceable to
			poverty. So the "save 100,000 babies" movement has for its slogan "<q who="UNK">Save
				that seventh child!</q>" We confess to finding this a ghastly mockery and an
			intolerable piece of irony. The agencies quoted appeal to the mothers to do the saving,
			but why more mothers do not save their babies is indicated pretty clearly by a circular
			sent out by a <org reg="Unidentified organization">charitable association</org>, which
			says "<q who="UNK">Tired and despairing mothers with the telling mark of day in and
				day-out grind on their features, midnight retiring and five o'clock rising-keeping
				the tattered ends of the housework together, struggling with the everyday problems
				of sickness, poverty and widowhood-three thousand seven hundred such mothers and
				children are waiting an invitation to <org reg="Sea Breeze Amusement Park">Sea
					Breeze</org>, but we must have help if we are to continue these outings</q>."
			The best that Society offers the child today is occasional charity to keep it alive, the
			only help that has thus far been suggested for the mother is two weeks of fresh air a
			year, plus a few weeks of prenatal care. But what is the matter with making birth
			control information free and open to all, so that seventh children shall not be born in
			an age when food, shelter, clothing and wholesome air are at a premium? The earlier
			offspring might then have a chance to grow up in decency and the mother to preserve her
			health. If the philanthropic reformers have not thought of that solution of the problem,
			we call it to their attention.</p>
		<p>THE CARE of the insane cost the <org reg="New York State Government">State of New York</org>
			$8,320,000 last year. The total economic loss on the insane for the year is officially
			estimated at more than $35,000,000. The institutions for the insane in <place>New
				York</place> are overcrowded to the extent of nearly 6,000 persons. There are
			already 37,069 persons in public institutions for the mentally defective and it is to be
			presumed that if these hospitals were not now overcrowded there would be some thousands
			more. And the number of insane and feeble-minded is increasing. And it is still a crime
			to impart to the mothers of such the information concerning birth control, which would
			save the state $35,000,000 a year and the relatives of the unfortunates inestimable
			trouble and sorrow. The facts and figures given are those of the recent annual report of
			the <org reg="New York State Hospital Commission">State Hospital Commission.</org> The
			commissioner recommended five means of preventing the increase of the number of the
			insane.</p>
		<list>
			<item>Checking the excessive use of alcohol.</item>
			<item>Checking the ravages of syphilis.</item>
			<item>Informing the public more fully concerning mental diseases and teaching mental
				hygiene.</item>
			<item>Steps to eliminate extreme poverty.</item>
			<item>Extension of out patient departments of state hospitals, etc.</item>
		</list>
		<p>It did not recommend the repeal of those survivals of witch burning days, the anti-birth
			control statutes. So far as the committee is concerned, this direct, simple and
			effective means of saving this huge cost of money and human agony is still criminal. And
			so far as the committee is concerned, it prefers $35,000,000 worth of criminal prejudice
			upon the part of officials and lawmakers, to birth control.</p>
