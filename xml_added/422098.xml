			<q who="PM">Before a banner which depicted the blue eagle's lighting bolt warring with
				numerous storks, Margaret Sanger today launched the first "American conference on
				birth control and national recovery."</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="PM">The small, red-haired, veteran birth control crusader predicted:</q>
		</p>
		<p>"the time is not far off when this government will be called upon to face the question of
			birth control and sterilization as well."</p>
		<p><q who="PM">She called attention to the legend of the banner above her head:</q>"Six
			million children in the <place>United States</place> on public relief. Two birth control
			bills pending in <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org>."</p>
		<p>
			<q who="PM"> She spoke to a well filled ball room, which had been hung with flags of
				many nations.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"We can lay at the doors of the opponents of this movement a large part of the misery and
			poverty arising from the huge array of unemployed."<q>she said.</q></p>
		<p> "If the <org reg="United States Government">government</org> will give the same
			consideration to the forgotten woman that it has to the forgotten man we may rectify the
			deplorable situation created by our birth rate."</p>
		<p>
			<q who="PM">The birth control movement, Mrs. Sanger said, began just 20 years ago,
				during which time eleven States, six regional and six international conferences have
				been held.</q>
