		<head>ABORTION "Woman and the New Race"</head>
		<head type="sub">"Woman and the New Race"</head>
		<byline>By <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger.</person></byline>
		<p>SOCIETY has not yet learned the significance of the age-long effort of the feminine
			spirit to free itself of the burden of excessive childbearing. It has been singularly
			blind to the real forces underlying the cause of infanticide, child abandonment and
			abortion. It has permitted the highest and most powerful thing in woman's nature to be
			hindered, diverted, repressed and confused. Society has permitted this inner urge of
			woman to be rendered violent by repression until it has expressed itself in cruel forms
			of family limitation, which this same society has promptly labeled "crimes" and sought
			to punish. It has gone on blindly forcing women into these "crimes," deaf alike to their
			entreaties and to the lessons of history.</p>
		<p>As we have seen in the second chapter of this book, child abandonment and infanticide are
			by no means obsolete practices. As for abortion, it has not decreased but increased with
			the advance of civilization. The reader will recall that one authority says that there
			are 1,000,000 abortions in the <place>United States</place> every year, while another
			estimates double that number.</p>
		<p>Most of the women of the middle and upper classes in America seem secure in their
			knowledge of contraceptives as a means of birth control. Under present conditions, when
			the laws in most states regard this knowledge, howsoever it be imparted, as illicit, and
			the federal statutes prohibit the sending of it through the mails, even the women in
			more fortunate circumstances sometimes have difficulty in getting scientific
			information. Nevertheless, so strong is their purpose that they do obtain it and use it,
			correctly or incorrectly.</p>
		<p>The great majority of women, however, belong to the working class. Nearly all of these
			women will fall into one of two general groups-the ones who are having children against
			their will, and those who, to escape this evil, find refuge in abortion. Being given
			their choice by society-to continue to be overburdened mothers or to submit to a
			humiliating, repulsive, painful and too often gravely dangerous operation, those women
			in whom the feminine urge to freedom is strongest choose the abortionist. One group goes
			on bringing children to birth, hoping that they will be born dead or die. The women of
			the other group strive consciously by drastic means to protect themselves and the
			children already born.</p>
		<p><q who="MH">"Our examinations,"</q> says <person reg="Hirsch, Max">Dr. Max
				Hirsch,</person> an authority on the subject, <q who="MH">"have informed us that the
				largest number of abortions (in the United States) are performed on married women.
				This fact brings us to the conclusion that contraceptive measures among the upper
				classes and the practice of abortion among the lower class, are the real means
				employed to regulate the number of offspring."</q></p>
		<p>Thus a high percentage of women in comfortable circumstances escape over-breeding by the
			use of contraceptives. A similarly high percentage of women not in comfortable
			circumstances are forced to submit to forced maternity, because their only alternative
			at present is abortion. When accidental conception takes place, some women of both
			classes resort to abortion if they can obtain the services of an abortionist.</p>
		<p>When society holds up its hands in horror at the "crime" of abortion, it forgets at whose
			door the first and principal responsibility for this practice rests. Does anyone imagine
			that a woman would submit to abortion if not denied the knowledge of scientific,
			effective contraceptives? Does anyone believe that physician and midwives who perform
			abortions go from door to door soliciting patronage? The abortionist could not continue
			his practice for twenty-four hours if it were not for the fact that women come
			desperately begging for such operations. He could not stay out of jail a day if women
			did not so generally approve of his services as to hold his identity an open but
			seldom-betrayed secret.</p>
		<p>The question, then, is not whether family limitation should be practiced. It is being
			practiced; it has been practiced for ages and it will always be practiced. The question
			that society must answer is this: Shall family limitation be achieved through birth
			control or abortion? Shall normal, safe, effective contraceptives be employed, or shall
			we continue to force women to the abnormal, often dangerous surgical operation?</p>
		<p>This question, too, the church, the state and the moralist must answer. The knowledge of
			contraceptive methods may yet for a time be denied to the woman of the working class,
			but those who are responsible for denying it to her, and she herself, should understand
			clearly the dangers to which she is exposed because of the laws which force her into the
			hands of the abortionist.</p>
		<p>It needs no assertion of mine to call attention to the grim fact that the laws
			prohibiting the imparting of information concerning the preventing of conception are
			responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year in this country and an untold
			amount of sickness and sorrow. The suffering and the death of these women is squarely
			upon the heads of the law-makers and the puritanical, masculine-minded persons who
			insist upon retaining the abominable legal restrictions.</p>
		<p><q who="MH">"He who would combat abortion,"</q> says Dr. Hirsch, and at the same time
			combat contraceptive measures may be likened to the person who would fight contagious
			diseases and forbid disinfection. For contraceptive measures are important weapons in
			the fight against abortion.</p>
		<p>
			<q who="MH">"America has a law since 1873 which prohibits by criminal statute the
				distribution and regulation of contraceptive measures. It follows, therefore, that
				America stands at the head of all nations in the huge number of abortions."</q>
		</p>
		<p>There is the case in a nutshell. Family limitation will always be practiced as it is now
			being practiced-either by birth control or by abortion. We know that. The one means
			health and happiness-a stronger, better race. The other means disease, suffering,
			death.</p>
		<p>The woman who goes to the abortionist's table is not a criminal but a martyr, a martyr to
			the bitter, unthinkable conditions brought about by the blindness of society at large.
			These conditions give her the choice between the surgeon's instruments and the
			sacrificing of what is highest and holiest in her-her aspiration to freedom, her desire
			to protect the children already hers. These conditions-not the woman-outface society
			with this question:</p>
