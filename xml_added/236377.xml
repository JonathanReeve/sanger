			<head>AN ADDRESS ON BIRTH CONTROL</head>
			<p><q who="RT">Mrs. Margaret Sanger, of New York, addressed an audience of 1,000 persons
					in the auditorium last night on the subject of birth control. She strongly
					advocated the dissemination of knowledge along this line and urged women to
					insist upon such information being public. The lecture was held under the
					auspices of the <org>Berks County Association of Women Workers</org>.</q></p>
			<p>"Out of seven women who have tuberculosis," <q who="RT">said the speaker,</q> "four
				die. If these women were granted the knowledge concerning birth control much of this
				fatality would be prevented."</p>
			<p><q who="RT">She cited instances where women appealed to physicians to aid them, but
					the doctors were forced by the law to turn the women away knowing that the woman
					would either die or the child would be mentally or physically incapable of
					assuming its share of the responsibility of life.</q></p>
			<p>"The natural instinct of the mother is to cherish and protect her child."<q who="RT">
					she said.</q> "If a woman knows she cannot do this properly she should be
				conversant with the subject of child control."</p>
			<p>"Women are becoming sick and tired of being but child bearing slaves and are
				demanding that they be released from this bondage. I would like to see a clinic
				established in every community where the women who desire it could secure
				information regarding the subject."</p>
