		<head>Birth Control--Past, Present and Future</head>
		<byline>By Margaret Sanger</byline>
		<p>The most revolutionary discovery of the nineteenth century, declares <person
				reg="Shaw, George Bernard">Bernard Shaw</person>, is that of the deliberate
			limitation of families. Although this discovery is now scarcely one hundred years old,
			it is most intimately bound up with the whole of contemporary Western civilization.
			Denounced and repudiated by the leaders of the Christian Church and also by the Marxian
			Socialists, the idea of "Birth Control" has nevertheless firmly planted its roots in
			Europe and <place reg="United States">America</place>, and has shown an ever increasing
			vitality. <person reg="Mill, John Stuart">John Stuart Mill</person>, one of the earliest
			and greatest economists, wrote: "<q who="MILJO">Little improvement can be expected in
				morality until the producing of large families is regarded with the same feeling as
				drunkenness or any other physical excess.</q>" To understand the ramifications, the
			background and the pivotal importance of Birth Control as a world problem of the present
			and immediate future, we must have a thorough grasp of the birth and evolution of this
			simple yet central problem of human existence. Once we have grasped its history, we are
			in a much better position to understand its physiological, hygienic and eugenic aspects
			and the part Birth Control must play, as an international weapon in the reconstruction
			of a world of peace, security, and universal prosperity. In the present paper,
			therefore, I shall consider: First, the historical and philosophic aspects of
			Malthusianism, neo-Malthusianism and Birth Control; and secondly, its hygienic and
			physiological side, and its relation to the world problem of the present and immediate
			future.</p>
		<p>In 1798, Rev. <person reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert">Thomas Malthus</person>, a clergyman
			of the <org>Church of England</org>, published the first edition of his
			world famous "<title type="book">Principle of Population</title>" which in 1806 was
			given to the world in a revised and more thorough form. In this epoch making essay,
			which was one of the most stimulating books ever given to the world and which attracted
			the attention of all great thinkers from that day to this, the English clergyman
			enunciated his challenging "theory of population," which has never been satisfactorily
			or completely refuted. His aim, in the "<title type="book">Principle of
				Population</title>" was: "<q who="MALTH">1 to investigate the causes which have
				hitherto impeded the progress of mankind toward happiness; and 2 to examine the
				probability of the total removal of those causes in future.</q>" The one great
			cause, he claimed, was "<q who="MALTH">the constant tendency in all animated life to
				increase beyond the nourishment prepared for it.</q>" This theory was based upon
			studies and statistics he gathered from all countries of the world, including
				<place>India</place>, <place>China</place> and <place>Japan</place>, and led Malthus
			to the conclusion that "<q who="MALTH">population, when unchecked, goes on doubling
				itself every 25 years, or increases in a <emph rend="italics">geometrical</emph>
				proportion. . . .But the food to support the increase from the greater number will
				by no means be obtained with the same facility. . . .It may fairly be pronounced,
				that considering the present average state of the earth, the means of subsistence,
				under circumstances the most favorable to human industry, cannot possibly be made to
				increase faster than in an <emph rend="italics">arithmetical</emph> ratio.</q>"</p>
		<p>Malthus showed that there were two checks to this too rapid increase in population.
			Whatever tends to produce a smaller number of births is called a <emph rend="italics"
				>preventive</emph> check; whatever leads to a greater number of deaths is termed a
				<emph rend="italics">positive</emph> check. Among the positive checks are wars,
			famines, epidemics, floods, infanticide and abortion. Among the preventive checks are
			the customs of continence, celibacy, late marriages, and prudence after marriage.
			Malthus advocated late marriages and "moral restraint." People should not marry until
			they had reached the age of about 38. But this was very soon seen to be impractical.</p>
		<p>The <org>Malthusian League</org>, organized in <place>England</place> in 1877, was
			founded upon the great central principles of population laid down by Malthus; but in
			view of a wiser understanding of human nature, advocated early marriage and limited
			parenthood, by the means of the deliberate and scientific prevention of conception. The
			principles of this society, which has international affiliations in all of the countries
			of Europe and the United States of America, are an admirable summary of the Malthusian
			and Neo-Malthusian doctrines. They are:</p>
		<list>
			<item>1. That population (unless consciously and sufficiently controlled) has a constant
				tendency to increase beyond the means of subsistence.</item>
			<item>2. That the checks which counteract this tendency are resolvable into positive or
				life-destroying, and prudential or birth-restricting.</item>
			<item>3. That the positive or life-destroying checks comprehend the premature death of
				children and adults by disease, starvation, war, and infanticide.</item>
			<item>4. That the prudential or birth-restricting checks consists in the limitation of
				offspring (1) by abstention from or postponement of marriage, or (2) by prudence
				after marriage.</item>
			<item>5. That prolonged postponement of marriage is not only productive of much
				happiness, but is also a potent cause of sexual vice and disease. Early marriage, on
				the contrary, tends to ensure sexual purity, domestic comfort, social happiness and
				individual health; but it is a grave social offence for men and women to bring into
				the world more children than they can adequately house, feed, clothe, and
				educate.</item>
			<item>6. That over-population is the most fruitful source of pauperism, ignorance, crime
				and disease.</item>
			<item>7. That it is of great importance that those afflicted with hereditary disease, or
				who are otherwise plainly incapable of producing or rearing physically,
				intellectually and morally satisfactory children, should not become parents.</item>
			<item>8. That the full and open discussion of the Population Question in all its
				necessary aspects is a matter of vital moment to Society.</item>
		</list>
		<p>How profound an influence upon European thought this Law of Population has, is indicated
			by the fact that it served as a basis for <person reg="Darwin, Charles"
			>Darwin</person>'s theory of natural selection, a theory that changed the complete
			current of European science in the nineteenth century.</p>
		<p>Until the advent of Neo-Malthusianism, when the attempt was first made to educate the
			population of the various European countries in various scientific methods of preventing
			conception, the Malthusian doctrine was still mostly in the philosophical stage of
			discussion. Its opponents, including the Marxians, argued that with increased
			production, the result of machinery in industry, and with wider more equitable
			distribution, there would be plenty of food for all classes of the population. But facts
			and statistics disproved this contention. With the increase of machine production, there
			arose an ever increasing demand for cheap labor, as well as for child labor. Machinery,
			by increasing production and distribution, became a fundamental cause in increasing the
			population. With the advent of the machine process in the nineteenth century in Europe
			and the United States that began the growth of the great, overcrowded cities, children
			became an economic asset. The birth rate increased enormously; and the helpless little
			victims of an inhuman industrial system were sent very early to work in the
			factories.</p>
		<p>In 1877 widespread publicity was given to the doctrine of the prevention of conception by
			the arrest of <person reg="Bradlaugh, Charles">Charles Bradlaugh</person>, a
			distinguished member of the <org>British Parliament</org>, and Mrs. <person
				reg="Besant, Annie">Annie Besant</person>, for publishing the work of an American
			physician, Dr. <person reg="Knowlton, Charles">Charles Knowlton</person>, entitled
				"<title type="book">The Fruits of Philosophy</title>." The attempt to curb their
			activities among the workers and the poor defeated its own purpose. The wide publicity
			resulted in the widespread adoption of their teaching. The better class of workers
			immediately began the exercise of voluntary parenthood; and this, combined with the laws
			forbidding child labor in the factories, had the effect of greatly decreasing the birth
			rate in England and <place>Scotland</place>, among the more skilled and intelligent
			laborers. From this date began the sharp decline in the birth rate, not merely in
			England, but in the more advanced countries of the <place reg="Europe">European
				continent</place> as well.</p>
		<p>It was soon discovered that a lower birth rate brought with it a lower death rate,
			especially a lower infant mortality rate. Fewer children were born, but more of them
			survived. The whole influence was toward placing a greater and greater value upon
			children and child-life. So true has this been that the preventive checks upon
			population, notably in <place reg="Netherlands">Holland</place>, have had the opposite
			effect to that intended in the doctrine of Malthus: the adoption of family limitation
			had actually led to an <emph rend="italics">increased</emph> and more healthy
			population.</p>
		<p>In the criticism of the Malthusian doctrine, which was brought to the foreground of
			European thought by the famous case of Charles Bradlaugh and Mrs. Besant in 1877, there
			has been a persistent failure to touch the core of the doctrine of overpopulation. The
			root of the misunderstandings concerning this doctrine is to be found in the failure to
			distinguish between what we may call <emph rend="italics">static</emph> and <emph
				rend="italics">kinetic</emph> overpopulation. Let me briefly define these:</p>
		<p>Static overpopulation is, the condition when the population of a country has increased up
			to its ultimate power of obtaining the necessary food supplies and subsistence.</p>
		<p><emph rend="italics">Kinetic</emph> overpopulation exists when the <emph rend="italics"
				>rate</emph> at which new arrivals in a country (by birth or immigration) exceeds
			the <emph rend="italics">rate</emph> at which additional subsistence can be provided for
			them.</p>
		<p>It should be borne in mind that neither Malthus nor the Neo-Malthusians of today have
			been concerned about any absolute limit to the food supply. There may be a few
			countries, e.g. China, in which a limit may be considered as having been actually or
			nearly reached, and which might be called actually or statically over-populated; but we
			are actually concerned with <emph rend="italics">kinetic</emph> overpopulation, with its
			more direct relation with poverty, disease, overcrowding, infant mortality,
			unemployment, insanity and feeblemindedness.</p>
		<p>I have pointed out that the campaign and the propaganda brought directly to the workers
			of England in 1877 had a direct and profound effect in decreasing the birth rate and
			subsequently the infant mortality rate. But an even more eloquent example of practical
			family limitation is to be found in the case of Holland, where this doctrine has been
			implanted in the population with the approval of the Government. Since 1881, information
			and science concerning the prevention of conception have been available to the people,
			and since 1885 there have been clinics for the spreading of hygienic information,
			including "birth control" to all women. This followed in the wake of a thorough and
			enthusiastic discussion of the subject at the international medical congress in
			Amsterdam in 1878. The results have been so gratifying that today <place
				reg="Amsterdam, Netherlands">Amsterdam</place> and <place
				reg="The Hague, Netherlands">The Hague</place> have the lowest infant mortality
			rates of any cities in the <place reg="Western World">Occidental world</place>. So great
			are the results obtained that there has been a remarkable increase in the physical
			strength, the stature and the longevity of the people, as well as in prosperity. When we
			contrast this gratifying result with the shocking deterioration in the lower classes in
				<place>Great Britain</place> as a result of the so-called industrial
			revolution--with its overcrowding and overwork, there can be little doubt of the
			efficacy of Birth Control in developing national strength.</p>
		<p>The practically universal practice of Birth Control in Holland for the last thirty-five
			years was put to the test during the Great War and was strikingly vindicated. Let us
			remember and reiterate that in Holland the <org reg="Nieuw-Malthusiaansche Bond"
				>Neo-Malthusian League</org> has since 1885 been engaged in teaching the poorer
			people, through the agency of physicians, midwives and nurses, in the best scientific
			means of Birth Control; that it has had the countenance and support of the ministers of
			State; and that it has been registered since 1895 as a Society of Public Utility.</p>
		<p>The most striking evidence of the success of this practice was brought out at the
				<org>Eugenics Congress</org>, when the fact was announced that the stature of the
			Dutch people was increasing more rapidly than that of any other race in the world. <emph
				rend="italic">The Dutch have gained no less than four inches in fifty
			years.</emph></p>
		<p>The proportion of young men drawn for the army taller than 5 feet 7 inches in height has
			increased from 24.50 per cent to 47.50 since 1865, while the proportion of men less than
			5 feet 2 &frac12; inches in height has fallen from 25 per cent to less than 8 per cent.
			When the Dutch Army was mobilized, the highest army standards showed that the men of the
			proper age for the service were 95 per cent. efficient, according to the highest
			standards. Contrast this with the example of the United States of America, where we were
			shocked to discover that our men were only 65 per cent efficient, and that with a
			lowered military standard.</p>
		<p>In my studies and investigations of this great problem I have paid several visits to
			Holland, both before and after the war, and my observations support these statistics.
			All the children you see there are suitably dressed. In the working classes there is a
			better personal and general hygiene, a fine moral and intellectual development. Morality
			is also on a much higher level. Prostitution, with its train of devastating diseases, is
			on the decline. Another great evidence, besides increased stature, is that of the
			constant increase in longevity. This is surely a test of physiological and financial
			progress. From 1890 to 1899 the average length of the Dutchman's life was 46.20 years.
			From 1900 to 1909 it was 51. These figures are equalled only by those from the <place
				reg="Scandinavia">Scandinavian countries</place>, where Birth Control was advocated
			and practiced even before it reached the Netherlands. It is also significant to point
			out that none of the dread consequences feared by its opponents, the clericalists, the
			moralists and the militarists have occurred. In spite of a low birth rate, the
			population of Holland is increasing. Undoubtedly this is because medical cooperation
			enables the Dutch people to practice the most scientific and hygienic methods of Birth
			Control. The race is not recruited from the underfed and the diseased. In Holland, where
			the poor are thoroughly educated in Birth Control, the families of the well-to-do are
			not so much reduced, in comparison with those of other European countries.</p>
		<p><place>Germany</place> on the other hand, is one of the few continental countries that
			discouraged and prohibited the practice of family limitation. It was opposed both by the
			government and the <org reg="Mehrheitssozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands">Social
				Democrats</org>. It was the boast of Imperial Germany that the children who were
			brought into the world at the behest of the State were well cared for and well educated;
			that they were sent out into the world as highly efficient and valuable citizens. But
			the great difficulty was, the protagonists of this philosophy admitted, that the State
			which had thus invested in the health and efficiency of her children, was too often
			deprived of their services by the narrow limits of her territory. She lost the fruits of
			their labors because they were forced out by overcrowding; so that alien and rival
			countries reaped the harvest of the German state's educational and cultural advantages.
			This, I believe, was the German Imperialist's argument for expansion. Today that empire
			is prostrate; millions of children are starving to death; and even those who survive
			this bitter struggle for existence, may be permanently afflicted. But the great fact to
			remember is that Germany fell as a result of the blockade. It is a striking case of the
			evil influence of a starving and prostrate civilian population unable to serve as the
			solid foundation for an army or to furnish new and efficient recruits to replace the
			dead and wounded. It can thus be seen that in the most intelligent sense
			Neo-Malthusianism may be supported as a thoroughly patriotic philosophy.</p>
		<p>Several years before the outbreak of the war, German advocates of Birth Control had
			pointed out that the underfeeding and overcrowding caused by large families was acting
			as a deterioration upon the physique of the conscripts for the Army. The masses were
			likewise beginning to see the light, although Birth Control was strenuously opposed by
			the Social Democrats. At a great meeting in <place reg="Berlin, Germany">Berlin</place>,
			August 29, 1913, <person reg="Luxemburg, Rosa">Rosa Luxemburg</person> and <person
				reg="Zetkin, Clara">Clara Zetkin</person> tried to arouse the workers against the
			"birth strike." The audience of 5,000 turned the meeting into a cry for Birth Control,
			and after howling down the Socialists, speaker after speaker arose and championed family
			limitation as the only effective means by which the masses could escape the worst evils
			of poverty, underfeeding and overcrowding, and the scourge of the great cotnagious
			disease. Today Germany is paying the penalty of uncontrolled breeding.</p>
		<p>In passing, it is an interesting fact to point out, that in the late war, it has been
			those European countries with a lower birth rate that have survived the conflict.
				<place>France</place> is an example especially of this. Birth Control had for
			decades been an ordinary and accepted practice in that country, growing out of the
			French habit of emphasizing the value of <emph rend="italics">quality</emph> in contrast
			to mere <emph rend="italics">quantity</emph>. The result of this had been prior to the
			war, that the struggle for life in France had not been too intense, and the people were
			permitted to enjoy the good things of the world. The result was a solidarity and
			stability of family life. The child was sure of the maximum of care, education and
			capital in continuing life. In great part it is owing to the low birth-rate that France
			had been one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and that her gold reserves
			per head exceeded the known averages of other European nations. Grinding poverty had
			been unknown in France, previous to the Great War. Temperance and thrift also are to be
			considered, but the small family unquestionably made for fair wages and fair rents. The
			outstanding feature of the French mother is her love for her children. It gains in
			intensity all that it loses in extent. The child is everything to her. Its well being,
			its early education, its training, are the perpetual care of the mother. Despite the
			present campaign to induce French women to have large families again, there is every
			indication that the spirit of intensive cultivation is too thoroughly ingrained in the
			French nature ever to be replace by a love of mere numbers.</p>
		<p>In <place>North America</place>, a great virgin territory, which to its early settlers
			seemed limitless and inexhaustible in natural resources and industrial possibilities,
			the dangers of overpopulation seemed so remote that the Neo-Malthusian doctrine at first
			aroused no interest at all. But into this "great melting-pot" flowed vast masses of
			immigrants. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the "New World" became the
			receptacle into which flowed all the surplus populations of the Old World. With the
			rapid development of machinery and vast railroad systems, great cities almost by magic
			sprang into existence. Population increased enormously, even more rapidly than Malthus
			had imagined. And with this uncontrolled human fecundity came the great unconquered
			problems of poverty, contagious and infectious diseases, epidemics, unemployment, labor
			troubles, race prejudice, and the limitation and exclusion of immigrants from other
			countries. Instead of preventing poverty or solving the population question, my own
			country, the United States, faces them today in a more serious and aggravated state than
			any of the nations of the Occidental world.</p>
		<p>My own interest in this question was aroused when as a nurse and worker for fourteen
			years among the poorer women of the slums, I was horrified to discover the amazing
			amount of human waste--women and children dying in vast numbers, while millions of
			dollars was being appropriated by the Government for the protection of cattle, sheep and
			swine. I discovered that one out of every ten children born died in its first year. And
			more women die in childbirth in the United States than in any other country in the
			world. And the great majority of these wholesale deaths of mothers and babies, according
			to a recent report of the <org reg="United States Children's Bureau">Children's Bureau
				of the United States Government</org>, are preventable. These poor women always
			asked me, as a nurse, to help them. They wanted fewer children who might have a chance
			to survive and grow into healthy men and women.</p>
		<p>When I began to search for the cause of the wide prevalence of the practice of abortion
			among all classes of American women, I discovered that the laws of the United States
			Government, as well as the laws of most of the separate states making up the Union,
			forbade the circulation of Birth Control knowledge, even by physicians and nurses. After
			a visit to the various countries of Europe, investigating the conditions of mothers and
			children, I returned to my own country to begin a campaign to educate the women of
			America in racial hygiene and health.</p>
		<p>My "Birth Control" agitation was inaugurated not upon the basis of the Malthusian theory
			of population, not to check the increase of population, but to prevent <emph
				rend="italics">the shocking waste of women and children</emph>. It was an answer to
			the cries of anguish that came to me from thousands of poor and diseased women who
			called out for relief bringing numbers of helpless, unwanted babies into their
			overcrowded world--infants foredoomed to an early death. It is one of the saddest sights
			in the poverty stricken and congested districts of any American city to notice the
			prevalence of busy midwives and prosperous undertakers, the latter exhibiting in their
			shops the various types of coffins for babies. These poor women are too ignorant perhaps
			to understand the philosophy of Malthus and his modern followers. But they can and do
			understand "Birth Control" because it is the direct answer to their immediate needs.
			This is the reason why the words "Birth Control" swept over the vast <place
				reg="North America">American continent</place> from coast to coast, and Birth
			Control Leagues were organized in all the great cities.</p>
		<p>Although the laws forbidding the circulation of Birth Control information are still in
			existence, they have for many years been ignored by the wealthy and intelligent upper
			and artisan classes of the American population. Uncontrolled breeding is the habit only
			of the ignorant poverty-stricken and submerged classes. Statisticians and eminent
			scientists show us that uncontrolled fertility is correlated with overcrowding, disease,
			unemployment, filth and ignorance; and that unless such fertility is checked in any
			community, the whole population will gradually deteriorate and degenerate. This is the
			great warning of Birth Control philosophy to all nations of the world today.</p>
		<p>In other directions, our campaign in the United States has stimulated a great interest in
			the care of mothers and training of children. The western world which had long professed
			horror and the ancient Oriental practice of exposing unwanted infants for the purpose of
			their destruction has now been brought to a sharp realization that there was a
			justification of that action on the part of starving parents in a famine ridden country,
			whereas there is no moral excuse for "the richest country in the world" to commit a
			quarter of a million children to preventable death. Is not our crime greater? Spurred
			into belated activity by the sharp criticism of the advocates of Birth Control, and
			alarmed at the prospect, that unless the conditions for child life are improved in
			America, women might refuse to bring them into the world, legislators are now advocating
			appropriations for the protection of motherhood and childhood. Birth Control advocates
			showed that conditions for motherhood and childhood are growing worse in the United
			States instead of better. Fourteen other nations are more advanced in this respect than
			the United States of America. The philosophy and propaganda of Birth Control has
			therefore done a great service in directing attention to a phase of human life that is
			of central and primary importance to the world, and yet is now most exposed to disaster
			and risk.</p>
		<p>It would be to neglect the most important phase of the philosophy of Birth Control, if,
			before taking up its hygienic aspect, I neglected to touch upon its relation to modern
			industry. Modern capitalism is desirous that kinetic overpopulation continue to provide
			abundant labor for the employing classes and thus to keep down wages, by the weight of a
			large margin of unemployed. But there is an unsuspected danger here. The statistics of
			the <org>Galton laboratory for National Eugenics</org> shows us that the unemployed in a
			generation or two are converted into the unemployable, and a dead weight on the
			community and the capitalist. Nevertheless the manufacture of babies and the extent of
			the supply of them still remains a matter of chance and passion very much as it is among
			animals in the wild state. To organized labor and to the working classes the philosophy
			of Birth Control emphasizes these facts:</p>
		<p>The history of labor is the history of an unsuccessful attempt on the part of man to
			bring his <emph rend="italic">productive</emph> ability up to the same level as his
				<emph rend="italic">reproductive power</emph>. It has been a losing battle all the
			way. We have never been able to secure peace or prosperity. We have never been able to
			control the aggression and forward push of modern machinery and capitalism. The worker
			is only too willing to blame the capitalist, not only for his own poverty, but for all
			the misery of the world. But there is another cause; that is the reproductive instinct,
			the uncontrolled fertility of living organisms. That created the first poverty. That
			created the first famine. That goaded all of mankind into the present industrial frenzy,
			into warfare and wandering and want and starvation, across seas into new lands. The big
			battalions of babies have made of human life an endless burden of heavy work. The
			principle of restricting the number of mouths to be fed should be accepted as the battle
			cry of labor and labor unions, who have always recognized and applied a like principle
			in the conduct of their own organizations. In refusing to admit more than a fixed number
