			<add>Address at Carnegie Hall</add>
		</head>
		<p>Your generous greeting <del>overwhelms</del>
			<add>delights</add> me. To me it expresses your faith and your conviction in the
			importance of the movement. I am dedicated to serve. I am glad to be with you tonight
			because your enthusiasm reassures me. It gives me hope that we need no longer fight this
			battle alone. I want to believe that your being here tonight means that you share with
			me the vision of a new world, that may become through the instrument of birth control a
			beautiful reality.</p>
		<p>In the first place, I want you to know that I did not go to the Far East as a
			self-appointed prophet to reform the habits of the yellow race. I have <emph
				rend="underline">never</emph> tried to shout the message of Birth Control into
			unwilling ears. We have advocated this doctrine only to those who have expressed a
			willingness <del>to bear</del>
			<add>or</add> interest in it. We do not believe in imposing upon anyone the principle or
			the practice of Birth Control. For a year previous to my departure, repeated invitations
			had come to me from Japan. On the part of Young <place>Japan</place> there has arisen a
			great desire to awaken their countrymen to the menace of overpopulation. A group of
			young Japanese intellectuals, called the <title>Kaizo</title>, or
				"<title>Reconstruction</title>" formulated the plan of inviting to Japan
			representatives of the most challenging ideas of our Western civilization. They invited
				<person reg="Russell, Bertrand">Bertrand Russell</person>, to lecture on
			Reconstruction, Professor <person reg="Einstein, Albert">Einstein</person> on the theory
			of Relativity, <person reg="Wells, H. G.">H. G. Wells</person> on International Peace
			and myself on Population and War. I was invited to follow Mr. Russell. You see, they put
			me in good company.</p>
		<p>I agreed to visit Japan to deliver five addresses, under the auspices of the Kaizo group.
			With great joy I set forth last February to carry the message of birth control into the
			Orient. I booked passage on the <name type="ship">Taiyo Maru</name>, and, escorted by my
			thirteen year old son <person reg="Sanger, Grant">Grant</person>, crossed the continent
			to <place reg="San Francisco, CA">San Francisco</place>. Two days before my sailing, the
			Japanese Consul refused to visa my passport. With many apologies and great regret he
			informed me that the Imperial Government had cabled directions that, if she applied for
			permission to visit Japan to lecture on Birth Control, Mrs. Sanger should be refused.
			Would I be permitted to enter as an individual, if I promised silence? The word came
				back--"<q who="UNK">No</q>."</p>
		<p>I was surprised, but not dismayed, for this official opposition was not new to me. As a
			matter of fact, the Imperial Japanese Government was only imitating the attitude of my
			own democratic government. And I knew, from past experience, that wherever this
			autocratic opposition to Birth Control is expressed by the official mind, there is
			always a tremendous popular interest not far away. I knew the new generation of Japan
			was interested, and I resolved to overcome this obstacle, not merely for my own
			satisfaction, but for the international good of the movement.</p>
		<p>Because I could not obtain that visa, the steamship company cancelled my booking. For a
			time defeat stared me in the face. The voyage seemed impossible; I would have to turn
			back. But then I remembered that I had overcome greater obstacles than this one. My
			Irish blood was up. I would not take this autocratic "No" as the final answer.</p>
		<p>Sometimes diplomacy is a better weapon than defiance. I decided to fight this battle
			behind the barricades of diplomacy. If the Imperial Japanese Government would not
			tolerate me, perhaps <place>China</place> would. There was no trouble in obtaining a
			Chinese visa. I returned to the office of the steamship company, secured passage for
				<place reg="Shanghai, China">Shanghai</place>, obtained the same stateroom on the
			Taiyo Maru I had previously booked, and sailed from San Francisco on the day I had
			originally planned.</p>
		<p>Aboard the Taiyo, I discovered as fellow passengers more than one hundred and fifty
			Japanese returning from the <name reg="Washington Naval Conference">Washington Peace
				Conference</name>, including the two delegates Admiral Baron <person
				reg="Kato, Tomosaburo">Kato</person>--now Prime Minister of Japan, and Mr. <person
				reg="Hanihara, Masanao">Hanihara</person>, who at that time was vice-minister of
				<org reg="Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs">Foreign Affairs</org>. Besides these
			distinguished Japanese, there was another party of delegates, under the leadership of
			Mr. <person reg="Mott, John">John Mott</person>, on their way to <place
				reg="Peking, China">Peking</place> to attend the conference of the <org>World
				Christian Student Federation</org>. A meeting had been arranged for me in <place
				reg="Honolulu, HI">Honolulu</place>, and although our boat arrived at one in the
			afternoon and sailed at five, I was able to speak to an audience which filled the hall
			to its capacity. I was received with no less enthusiasm by the Japanese than by the
			American residents there. The Japanese press had even arranged a dinner for that
			evening, in the event the Taiyo Maru remained. I could not accept therefore, but during
			my few hours stay, the nucleus of a Hawaiian Birth Control League was organized.</p>
		<p>This demonstration in Honolulu reacted upon my fellow passengers aboard the Taiyo Maru.
			During the next two weeks every one aboard seemed to be discussing the pros and cons of
			Birth Control. They began to crowd into my cabin to ask questions. Finally I was invited
			to address the Japanese delegation from the Peace Conference. Admiral Kato and Mr.
			Hanihara attended. The feelings of my own countrymen were hurt because they were not
			invited. So finally I had to speak to the missionaries as well. Then the passengers of
			the second cabin besieged me with requests, and I spoke to them also.</p>
		<p>After I had addressed the Japanese delegates, the radio messages began to fly between our
			ship and Japan. In particular Mr. Hanihara was especially <emph rend="underline"
				>kind</emph>. He sent a radio message to his government, stating that, in his
			opinion, the subject of Birth Control, as he had heard it expounded, was in no way
			offensive to public morals. He recommended his government to lift the ban, to permit me
			to enter Japan, and to allow the free discussion of this problem.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, as I later learned, discussion and protest was raging in Japan. Every
			newspaper was expressing its opinion on the exclusion of America's undesirable citizen.
			Not all of them thought that I should be admitted. But the <add>great</add> majority of
			them were of the opinion that the Home Office made a mistake in taking such drastic
			action before I had at least made some remarks in Japan, upon which an opinion could be
			passed.</p>
		<p>Then I began to receive radio messages from Japan--one reading: "<q who="UNK">Thousands
				disciples welcome you.</q>" The next: "<q who="UNK">Possible both land <place
					reg="Yokohama, Japan">Yokohoma</place>. Welcome discourse.</q>" The next day:
				"<q who="UNK">Possible land Yokohama. Impossible discourse.</q>" Radio messages from
			all sorts of organizations asking me to lecture; a radio message from the medical
			association of <place reg="Kyoto, Japan">Kyoto</place>; a radio message from the "<org
				reg="Kobe Cultural Socierty">Cultural Society of <place reg="Kobe, Japan"
					>Kobe</place></org>"; a radio message from the New Women's Organization <del>of
				Nagoya</del> a message from a commercial group in <place reg="Tokyo, Japan"
				>Tokyo</place>; another from an industrial group of Yokohama; a greeting from the
			doctors of <place reg="Nagoya, Japan">Nagoya</place>; one, even, from the <org>Young
				Men's Christian Association of Tokyo</org>. And still I did not know whether I would
			be permitted to land. But it was some satisfaction, at any rate, to know that the
			opposition of the government had aroused the Japanese press and public to a discussion
			of Birth Control. For once people begin <emph rend="underline">seriously</emph> to
			discuss Birth Control, our battle is more than half won.</p>
		<p>Such was the situation when we arrived at Yokohama harbor on the tenth of March. As the
			Taiyo Maru entered the bay, she was surrounded by a fleet of small craft. Government
			officials, health officials, representatives of the police department, and a mob of
			newspapermen and cameramen flocked on board. I learned later that no less than seventy
			permits to board the Taiyo Maru had been issued to the representatives of the press.
			Then I had to submit to the severest test and strain of my journey.</p>
		<p>First with a government official, an interpreter and a stenographer I was closeted for an
			hour. At the end of that time the official had committed himself to the effect that,
			providing the American consulate general in Japan would make a formal and official
			request to permit me to land, the ban might be raised. Now I had already, by radio, sent
			a message to the American Consul asking him, as an American citizen, to use his power in
			this direction, stating that I wished at any rate to visit Japan, if not as a
			propagandist, at least as a private citizen. And so, after this conference, I hurried
			off another cable telling him I was awaiting his assistance. During this time, I was
			besieged by reporters and photographers. I waited for the reply of our American Consul.
			It did not come. Not only did the representative of my government refuse to make a
			formal request for my admittance, he did not even condescend to the courtesy of a reply
			to either of my messages. <del>He did not explain the reasons for his indifference to
				the rights of an American citizen.</del></p>
		<p>At seven thirty that evening, without the sponsorship of the American Consul, but due to
			great popular pressure and protest, it was as an individual that the Imperial Japanese
			Government opened its gates to me.</p>
		<p>I am sorry that I cannot thank the American Consul. I must thank intelligent wide-awake
			young Japan, expressing itself in agitation and protest, that show the power of
			organized public opinion over official autocracy. Yet I could not help wondering, if the
			case had been reversed, and I was seeking to enter this country, would there have been
			the same help, the same agitation and demand on the part of our citizens?</p>
		<p>The final order was to undergo the inspection of the customs officials. They must have
			thought that I possessed some magic wand to depopulate Japan. After confiscating most of
			my books, I was allowed to go.</p>
		<p>Just as I finished this inspection and was at last free, I was approached by several
			rickshaw men who came to welcome me to Japan as representatives of the <org>Rickshaw
				Men's Union</org>. One spoke a little English and courteously apologized for the
			unwarranted action of the Home Office. "<q who="UNK">You do not mind</q>", he said. "<q
				who="UNK">Sometime Japanese Government, he little autocratic.</q>" I did not mind. I
			felt almost at home.</p>
		<p>Today, the first impression one gets of Japan is that the old order has been swept away
			by modern industrialism. In Yokohama and Kobe one hears factory whistles and sees the
			tall smokestacks of industrial plants. There are tall cranes in new shipyards. The
			industrial revolution, which first began about sixty years ago has penetrated into the
			smaller villages. The war quickened this transformation of Japanese society, and is
			making great changes in the lives of the working millions. This industrial change has
			not been a gradual one. It has come with little preparation and sharp suddenness.
			Without warning, Japan has been thrust from a feudal system into an industrial system
			not unlike our own. The Japanese people have had no background of understanding or
			experience upon which to meet these new conditions. This factory system has been thrust
			upon a complex feudal society unprepared to meet it. The masses of the people, mostly
			peasants, had been ruled by feudal loyalty, by clan and guild bonds, by a religion of
			personal submission, by century-old superstitions and racial prejudice. Under the old
			order, the power of money played practically no part. The industrial revolution has
			changed all that.</p>
		<p>Long hours, low pay, and the ever-growing realization that there is a new class springing
			up which is repeating the profits of this new change, are awakening the masses to the
			new order of life. These masses are thirsting for education, aiming for higher standards
			of living, and are spurred on by the desire to get rich too. As in other industrial
			countries, there is evident everywhere increasing social unrest. But one of the most
			important facts of this condition is that from seventy to seventy-eight percent of the
			factory workers are women--girls and women. These women factory workers are sent out of
			the rural districts and the villages and contracted, practically sold, to the factories
			for periods of two to three years. They are housed in large dormitories. In most cases,
			the greater part of their wages are sent to their families by their employers. Modern
			Japanese industrialism has thus been able to take advantage of ancient customs and
			superstitions, according to which a girl child was deemed of little value. But,
			nevertheless, today, as their economic value increases, these girls and women are
			undergoing the cruel education of modern industry. They are no longer slaves to custom
			and tradition. They are learning to look squarely at the facts of life.</p>
		<p>Japan, then, has definitely embraced industrialism--or perhaps it would be truer to say
			that industrialism has embraced Japan. But there are certain conditions which make
			Japan's domestic problem ever more complex and dangerous than that of any other country.
			She possesses an area about the size of <place>California</place>. But five-sixth of
			this area is mountainous and untillable. She has a population of approximately sixty
			millions, a high birth rate of more than a million, which increases this population from
			seven to eight hundred thousand every year. While the actual density of population is no
			higher than that of other countries, the density in the tillable or agricultural areas
			averages two thousand men, women and children to the square mile. So that as one travels
			through this curious little country, one finds every available inch of ground under
			cultivation. Rice paddies are built on hillsides. There are few playgrounds; there are
			no lawns and fields in which children can play properly. I never saw so many children
			anywhere. The babies are carried upon the backs of the older children, even in play, and
			while you see a country of one story houses, you also see a country of two story
			children.</p>
		<p>Such, is the situation in Japan: a rapidly increasing population, a lack of tillable
			land. She is dependent more and more upon imports for food and clothing. She may
			increase her shipping and her foreign trade, but she cannot keep pace with her growing
			population. Thus there are two alternate policies; expansion, <del>exigration</del>
			<add>emigration</add>, aggression, imperialism, enforced by armament and militarism. On
			the other hand, a drastic national policy of birth control limiting the numbers,
			improving living conditions and aiming at the perpetuation of peace and the development
			of art and science. As for the first policy, that of emigration and expansion, we must
			realize that Japan cannot imitate the earlier colonial policies of the European powers.
			She cannot send her surplus millions to foreign countries. This affords but temporary
			relief and complicates the international problem tenfold.</p>
		<p>Realizing that this is the admitted situation, you can understand something of the great
			popular interest in Birth Control in Japan. Therefore I resolved to find out why the
			Imperial Japanese Government was so afraid of my message. By questioning my Japanese
			friends I found out that the news of my coming had divided opinions into two main
			currents. A bill had been introduced in Parliament called the "<name type="law"
				reg="Dangerous Thoughts Bill">Dangerous Thought Bill.</name>" This had been
			introduced by a group of reactionaries, called by the Japanese "Thought Controllers."
			They aimed to exclude from the country all thoughts and ideas which they considered
			menacing to ancient Japanese traditions. They wanted ideas to be one hundred percent
			Japanese. I am glad to say that during my stay in Japan, this ridiculous bill was
			defeated.</p>
		<p>Then I found out that a rumor had spread throughout the country, before I arrived, that I
			was a secret agent of the American government, sent to deplete the population of Japan
			by my own special magic and miraculous method. They said that I was the advance agent of
			an American invasion.</p>
		<p>I was indignant that the police governor had refused me permission to speak in public,
			and I resolved to find out the real source of opposition. I arranged the second day
			after my arrival to call on the police governor of Japan, whose bureau was located in
			Tokyo. I went to the police department nursing my indignation. But it was impossible to
			remain angry in the face of the extreme courtesy with which I was received. Although it
			was but ten in the morning, tea was served and current topics--with the exception of
			birth control, was politely discussed. Then, through an interpreter, I was told that my
			name had created confusion and amusement, owing to the similarity between Sanger and
				"<foreign lang="JAP">Sangai San</foreign>" which means "destructive to production."
			The chief of police and assistants had read my books. They had been translated and
			published without my permission, and were already making converts even in the police
			department. The outcome of this interview was that I was permitted to speak in
			public--not on Birth Control, but on population, to private groups and before clubs and
			such organizations, on the subject of birth control, without police interference.</p>
		<p>As a result, I was able, during my brief stay, to make thirteen addresses in the various
			cities of Japan. The extent of the interest that had been aroused in the subject was
			indicated by the fact that out of 101 monthly magazines published in Japan, no less than
			81 carried in their April issues leading articles on the subject of Birth Control.
			Government and police opposition had won for us a hearing that non-interference might
			not have gained.</p>
		<p>But the deeper significance of this triumph is to be found in the growing power of Young
			Japan and liberal opinion. Ten years ago, the drastic decree of the Imperial Japanese
			Government would undoubtedly have been accepted as final. But when it was announced that
			I had been excluded, all sorts of protests, all sorts of agitation and the most
			outspoken comments followed the action of the government officials. Due to popular
			pressure, the Home Office permits me to enter if I maintain silence. Still further
			protests, still greater agitation, still sharper criticism, and the Home Office
			compromises further. "<q who="UNK">She may speak, but not publicly.</q>" More agitation,
			more protests; then "<q who="UNK">She may speak publicly but not on Birth Control.</q>"
			I attribute these victories to the awakening intelligence, the courage and the bravery
			of the new generation of Young Japan.</p>
		<p>After battling in this country and in this city with gross wholesale, unthinking
			stupidity, cloaking itself with the name of religion and Democracy, it is a joy to be
			received even by one's opponents with intelligent respect and courtesy. I did not meet
			with prurient and vulgar leers and ribald laughs. At the <org>Peers Club</org>, I spoke
			to a gathering of twenty-five of the most eminent dignitaries of the country. They were
			highly educated gentlemen, so familiar with the English language that no interpreter was
			necessary. In this exalted atmosphere of keen sophisticated intelligence, I could speak
			with perfect freedom without misunderstanding or misinterpretation. I could not help
			comparing the breadth and subtlety of the minds of these officials of the Imperial
			Japanese Government with the unspeakable vulgarity and leering crudity of the
			politicians of <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>, when we tried to bring the
			problem of Birth Control to the attention of our state legislators at <place
				reg="Albany, NY">Albany</place>.</p>
		<p>From Japan I went to <place>Korea</place> and addressed a group at <place
				reg="Seoul, Korea">Seoul</place>, consisting of bankers, missionaries, physicians,
			business men. There was a great opportunity for one to settle down in Korea, for the
			Koreans are alert, ambitious and are anxious to partake in the new thought of the
			western world.</p>
		<p>From Korea I went to Peking and there was able to address 2500 students in the <org
				reg="Peking University">Government University of Peking</org>. I also spoke at the
				<org>Rockefeller Institute</org> as well as at a gathering of bankers, who gave a
			luncheon in my honor.</p>
		<p>I was particularly interested in the method of the Chinese in their grasp of the subject,
			and in their method of quick action when once they have a subject in hand. The
			chancellor of the university invited me to dinner after the afternoon meeting. There
			were present a number of the professors and some others who were considered the
			"intelligentsia" of Peking. There were some splendid suggestions made that afternoon for
			carrying on the work, and the formation of a league was formed that night; but the
			immediate need was for practical methods, and they took the pamphlet "<title type="book"
				>Family Limitation</title>", translated it into Chinese, and the next morning that
			material was on the press, and five thousand pamphlets were printed and ready for
			distribution the next day.</p>
		<p>If anyone wishes to refute the Malthusian theory, it is worth while before wasting his
			time, to take a trip to China, for there the population question with all the horrors
			that Malthus depicted, is vindicated.</p>
		<p>All available ground is taken up for the production of their food supply; even the roads
			are turned into gardens, and while China might well go on for thousands of years more,
			if undisturbed by Christianity and the humanitarian methods of the western nations, she
			cannot go on undisturbed by our interference. We cannot go into China with our
			sympathies and our moral codes saving the babies from infanticide, without increasing
			her problems. We find that after we have gone and rescued infants from the river one
			year, only to find an increase of "sing song" girls eking out their existence in
			prostitution the following year. We simply rob Peter to pay Paul in all of these
			methods, because we are not dealing with fundamentals.</p>
		<p>While the Chinese woman gives birth to infants year after year, the great percentage of
			these infants dies, which keeps her population practically at a standstill.</p>
		<p>If we will let China alone, she may work out in a few more thousand years very brilliant
			examples of the survival of the fit. In fact, some of our economists and sociologists
			think that she has done so today, but we cannot interfere with her in the way we have
			been interfering without making her problems more difficult and complex.</p>
		<p>The women of China in my estimation <del>are</del>
			<add>have an</add> intelligent <add>grasp of life</add> beyond the women of Japan. In
			some ways I found them superior to the women of the occidental world, for though they
			may still bind their feet, and many of them are suffering from the habit of foot
			binding, they are not to be so much deplored not pitied as some of our English and
			American women, whose minds have never been unbound.</p>
		<p>China and Japan Illustrate two different degrees of overpopulation. The population of
			Japan is still expanding, overflowing. Overpopulation in China has reached its tragic
			culmination.</p>
		<p>The situation in Japan today is almost identical with that of the German Empire in 1910.
			With a limited territory the high birth rate in <place>Germany</place> increased the
			density of population so that there arose a cry for expansion, for new colonies, for new
			territories, for "a place in the sun." And national expansion, based on potential
			overpopulation, breeds militarism and the machinery of war. Today we know how Germany
			fared in its great effort to <del>dominate Europe</del><add>spread out</add>. We know
			how the high birth rate or overpopulated countries fared in the war. The dangers of a
			militaristic policy for Japan should be apparent to all impartial observers. We ought to
			know more about a high birth rate as one of the causes of war. But even if Japan seeks a
			solution to her domestic problem by peaceful, commercial and industrial expansion, by
			sending out of her country its surplus millions, this is no adequate remedy. The disease
			must break out in some other part of the world. To export low grade labor, hordes of
			coolies to upset the stability of the labor markets, is to destroy all possibilities of
			peace in the political and industrial spheres.</p>
		<p>In China we witness the last act in the national tragedy of over-population. Here is a
			great Empire prostrate in the dust. China, the mysterious fountainhead of art,
			philosophy and the deepest wisdom of the world, has been brought down by the breeding
				<add>&amp;</add> multiplication of the worst elements of the yellow race. It is
			difficult for anyone who has not visited China to realize the situation. Here are masses
			of humans who live below the level of animals. They eat, sleep, and breed in the crowded
			streets and sunless alleys. Thousands haven't even a foothold on land. They are
			compelled to live in makeshift boats on the banks of rivers. Go through the reeking
			labyrinth of one of these native Chinese cities. Go on a day when a hot sun brings out
			all of these wretched incurably diseased specimens of what we dignify by the name of
			human. Go through those narrow, choked streets, as I did one day last April, and you may
			see these wretched creatures pawing over piles of garbage and refuse. There in these
			quarters, the incurably diseased and leprous breed with the profligacy and
			thoughtlessness of flies. I recall one unforgettable, unspeakable picture I saw in the
			native quarters of Shanghai; the prostrate body of a leper woman, covered with rags; her
			naked diseased children climbing over this inert figure, from a hole in the darkness
			above the rays of the sun beat down in a single shaft. Horrified by this spectacle we
			moved on, followed by a crowd of starving, naked children, some of them blind, all
			unspeakably diseased, crying in pitiful voices for coppers. Such are the results of
			obeying the age-old injunction to increase and multiply, carried to a literal
			conclusion. Such is the punishment of a herdlike obedience to blind instinct, of
			non-interference with the course of Nature.</p>
		<p>Many of us have the greatest respect and reverence for the ancient culture of China. We
			appreciate the keenness and the depth of the finer expressions of the Chinese spirit. We
			bow before this ancient civilization of Asia, the fountainhead, in many respects of
			human wisdom. Therefore all the greater is the tragedy of China. The fine flame of the
			ancient Asiatic spirit there is flickering. It is threatened with extinction. There is
			the rising tide of famine, of wretchedness and the epidemic of transmissible diseases, a
			flood which, because of the incessant fertility of these millions, spreads like a human
			plague.</p>
		<p>How does that concern us in America? you may ask. Very directly is it the concern of
			every one of us. We must keep alive the finer achievement of the spirit, in all parts of
			the world. But it is our concern in an even more direct manner. Not a day, not a month,
			not a year passes but that we are asked to contribute to famine funds, to the support of
			Christian missions in China and Japan, and to other Far Eastern philanthropies. It is an
			obvious fact that the great part of these funds is not devoted to the aid of what I
			consider the finer things of China, but to the never-ending task of temporarily
			relieving the miseries of the lower elements. Strip this work of its high sounding
			virtues, and we find that it is actually the work of relieving and perpetuating types
			who never should have been born at all, much less allowed to reproduce and perpetuate
			their miseries and their diseases. This is like trying to sweep the sea back with a
			broom, or to carry water with a sieve. Let these missionaries remember the <title>Sermon
				on the Mount</title>: "<q who="BIB">Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of
				thistles? A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit; neither can a good tree
				bring forth evil fruit. Each tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
				and cast into the fire.</q>"</p>
		<p>But as long as the American public prefers sentimentality to Science, this waste of funds
			to throw into the bottomless pit of charities and philanthropies may be expected to
			continue. Meanwhile the work of cleaning up our own national house is neglected, and the
			millions which should go into American research, American science and to the cultivation
			and refinement of American life are diverted to this mad carnival of sloppy
			sentimentality.</p>
		<p>China does not need our religion. And in exporting our religions to Asia, we are not
			doing much to bridge the chasm between the Occidental mind and the Oriental. Instead, we
			are developing new misunderstanding. I repeat; the Chinese do not need religion. They
			need our science, sanitation, hygiene, Birth Control.</p>
		<p>You cannot measure the greatness of a country by the mere size of its population. We
			cannot gauge civilization merely in terms of industrial expansion and growth. National
			greatness is not a matter of large standing armies and invincible navies. Is a country
			breeding great men? Will they leave for the generations of the future a record of
			immortal poetry, art and philosophy? Then it is a great country, for it has attained the
			only immortality worth striving for. <del>And in holding this as our ideal, in striving
				upward the human race should first of all be freed of the millstones of disease,
				famine, and the fatal burden of inherited disease. There are other hindrances in the
				endless march toward our unknown goal. We are not helping ourselves by adding to
				them the blight of inherited disease, bad breeding and blasted childhood.</del></p>
		<p>After my eight months tour of the world, I am led to agree with H. G. Wells when he says
			that the whole world at present is swarming with cramped, dreary, meaningless lives,
			lives which amount to nothing and which use up the resources and surplus energies of the
			world. <del>Our world is overcrowded with masses who are merely the breeding crowd of
				admitted misery and wretchedness.</del> They do nothing to carry life forward. They
			are just the vain, defective imperfect repetitions of all that has gone before. <del>Our
				charity to these masses is in reality a crime against future generations, against
				the finest blossoming of the human spirit.</del> Upon these docile, herdlike masses,
			the sinister evil demagogues of the church and nation fatten. We cannot shirk the
			inevitable duty of descending, like <person reg="Socrates (Greek)">Socrates</person>,
			into the market place and to the utmost of our ability to undo the work of these blind
			leaders of the blind who are urging the unfit "full speed" ahead in these mad spawning
			and swarming.</p>
		<p>The world is overpopulated in more ways than one. There are too many people for our
			limited intelligence. There are too many people for the social systems evolved. There
			are too many people for our present equipment, transportation, housing,
			schools--everything which should help to advance our civilization; and there are too
			many people for the means of subsistence in a great majority of countries.</p>
		<p>I came back from my eight months trip around the world more convinced than ever that the
			people of the world are ready and eager for the practice of Birth Control. The officials
			of all governments are blind to its importance. The leaders of the churches are opposed
			to Birth Control. But as a whole, the masses themselves are looking to it as to a
			deliverance. Birth Control is not merely a problem of the individual women; it is not
			merely a national question. It is <del>not</del> a world problem. As <person
				reg="Keynes, John Maynard">John Maynard Keynes</person> stated, at the time of our
				<org reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 5th">London
				Conference</org>, the problem of population is going to become in the near future
			the greatest of all political questions. Already the very mention of Birth Control
			arouses some of the deepest instincts and emotions. Feelings are running, as Mr. Keynes
			suggested, as passionately as in the earlier struggles between religions. We stand today
			at one of the great transition points in human history. If civilization is to survive,
			men and women must grasp control away from the blind instinct of Nature <supplied
				resp="MSPP">remainder of this document is drawn from the previous draft</supplied>
			and they must develop the intelligence and the wisdom to direct the energies of life
			into the realms of the Spirit.</p>
		<p>This is a problem that requires every ounce of courage and bravery of which we are
			capable. Our enemies are not sleeping. they are aggressive, bold, insulting. Have the
			courage to back us up. But above all, have the courage of your convictions. It is the
			duty of every one of us, not merely to give a passive assent to this new vision, this
			new morality, but to do everything in our power to extend and strengthen the growing
			current of public opinion in favor of Birth Control for the individual, for the nation
			and for the world. We are fighting for the women and the children of the present
			generation; we are fighting for the children, women and the men of the next generation.
			We want a world freer, happier, cleaner. We want a race of thoroughbreds. Remember that
			no historical movement can attain maturity in one generation. Remember that it took two
			hundred and eighty years for Christianity to be accepted in the Roman Empire. Remember
			that one hundred and fifteen years elapsed after the discovery of the New World before
			the first english colony was planted here. No one who saw the beginning of these great
			historic movements could grasp their full import. Nor shall we, who are advocating the
			cause of Birth Control, ever witness its culmination. But it is good to remember that
			the first step toward international peace has at last been taken, <del>because</del>
			<add>for</add> the idea of birth control has now triumphantly girdled the globe. </p>
