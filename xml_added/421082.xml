			<p>
				<q who="JCPT">Mrs. Margaret Sanger returned from a tour of <place>Asia</place> today
					with a new formula for regulating the size of families for 25 cents a year.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="JCPT">Mrs. Sanger hopes the formula eventually will be the answer to present
					bans against disseminating birth control information.</q>
			</p>
			<p><q who="JCPT">It may also, she said, be</q> “the answer to the social workers’
				prayers,” <q who="JCPT">and to refusal of the <org>American Medical
						Association</org> to help change the laws.</q></p>

			<p> “I have tried for 20 years to corral people into their doctors’ offices to learn
				about birth control because as a trained nurse I have always believed that birth
				control is individual and that each woman should consult her physician on her own
				needs,” <q who="JCPT">Mrs. Sanger said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="JCPT">If the doctors refuse to see that present laws force people to consult
					“bootleggers” of birth control information then they must expect people to go
					elsewhere, Mrs. Sanger said.</q>
			</p>

			<head type="sub">Assails A.M.A.</head>
			<p>“The doctors who made that report possibly have adequate information for their
				private practice,” <q who="JCPT">she said.</q> “Their patients can get advice and
				equipment. They probably have not seen enough of the poor in hospitals. If the
				medical profession had met its responsibilities in this respect, the A.M.A.
				committee could not complain that the educated class is not producing itself while
				the poorer classes are over-producing. </p>
			<p><q who="JCPT"> When the A.M.A. committee says there is no evidence that present laws,
					federal or state, have interfered with</q>“any medical advice which a physician
				has felt called upon to furnish his patients, they should remember that within two
				years, two doctors and two nurses in the New York birth control clinic were
				arrested, and that last week in Washington, the scientific contraceptive exhibit of
				the <org>District of Columbia Medical Association</org> was stopped," Mrs. Sanger
				said. </p>
