		<head>BIG DECREASE IN BIRTH RATE</head>
		<dateline><place reg="Washington, DC">WASHINGTON</place>, <date value="1934-06-02">June
				2</date>
			<org reg="Associated Press">AP</org>--</dateline>
		<p>
			<q who="MMI">A plunge in the <place>United States</place>' birth rate--certain to carry
				the 1933 figure to a new low, and still dropping--was disclosed today by the <org
					reg="United States Census Bureau, Department of Vital Statistics">Bureau of
					Vital Statistics</org>.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="MURTI">"We did not expect a decrease as rapid as it is,"</q>
			<q who="MMI">said Dr. Timothy F. Murphy, chief of the bureau, reporting of the
				plummet-like movement. </q>
			<q who="MURTI"> "A situation though to have extended over a long period of years has
				been hastened."</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="MMI"> Margaret Sanger, veteran birth control exponent, was quick to call the
				declining birth rate a general boon as well as a triumph for her cause.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"The birth rate can well afford to go down," <q who="MMI">she said.</q> "On the basis of
			the enormous population increase of the past, the birth rate must be lowered. A
			decreased birth rate doesn't mean a population decrease. Fewer babies are born, but with
			much less infant mortality, there is a better rate of survival." </p>
		<p>
			<q who="MMI">The drop has been from 25.1 births per 1,000 population in
					<date>1915</date> to 17.4 in <date>1932</date>.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="MMI">Dr. Murphy partly agreed with the theory put before the <org
					reg="National Conference of Social Work">social workers convention</org> in
					<place reg="Kansas City, MO">Kansas City</place> last week--that the decline was
				due to voluntary control of conception.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q who="MURTI">"But there are other important factors, too,"</q>
			<q who="MMI">he said.</q><q who="MURTI">"The number of marriages goes down in a
				depression. Parents are separated by economic pressure. Immigration restrictions
				have cut off the large influx of southern Europeans who have large
			families."</q>.</p>
