		<head>Mrs. Sanger Here</head>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Advocate of Birth Control to Be at Helig Monday.</head>
			<p><q who="PO">A bright, womanly little woman stepped from the train late yesterday. You
					wouldn't have picked her out as one who was radical or in any way unusual--if
					courage of one's conviction may be regarded as unusual.</q></p>
			<p><q who="PO">It was Margaret Sanger, exponent
					of birth control, the woman who was arrested in <place reg="New York, NY">New
						York City</place> for publishing and sending through the mails her magazine,
					the <title type="journal">Woman Rebel</title>, a publication exploiting birth
					control.</q></p>
			<p><q who="PO">Several members of the local league met Mrs. Sanger and escorted her to
					the <org>Hotel Portland</org>, where, after finding a cool spot and being
					initiated to loganberry juice in an iced drink, she gave an interview.</q></p>
			<p><q who="PO">Her broadest views, her strongest message she will give on Monday night
					when she has promised to speak in the <org>Helig Theater</org>.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Tour is Extension of Effort.</head>
			<p><q who="PO">This lecture tour is her first attempt at big public work. Heretofore she
					gave informal talks to groups of girls in New York City, instructing them in
					hygiene and sanitation. She is a trained nurse, a mother of <person
						reg="Sanger, Grant"><person reg="Sanger, Stuart"><person reg="Sanger, Peggy"
								> three children</person></person></person>, aged respectively 12, 8
					and 6 and she is a social worker of wide experience. The children are now with
						<person reg="Sanger, Henrietta Wolffberg">grandma Sanger</person>. She says
					she has seen the misery of poverty and sickness in her visits as a nurse and she
					made up her mind to </q>"get at the cause of the trouble."</p>
			<p>“I have been called in turn a vile female, a person with a barnyard philosophy, a
					<name type="deity">God</name>-send, the greatest woman of the century, the
				counterpart of <person reg="Lincoln, Abraham">Abraham Lincoln</person>, and a
				horrible creature,”<q who="PO"> said Mrs. Sanger.</q> “Rather conflicting epithets,
				but I go on doing what I believe to be right, carrying a message of help, as I
				believe it to be.”</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">"Blue Laws" Wanted Repealed.</head>
			<p>“I am of the opinion that a greater knowledge of birth control will raise the
				standard of morality instead of lowering it, and I am making an appeal to the
				Western women voters to help in my campaign to repeal the puritanical laws as they
				exist. They are a relic of the dark ages.”</p>
			<p><q who="PO">Mrs. Sanger thinks that young couples who are in love should marry
					early--provided they really are in love. Girls should be told the things that
					are vitally important, says Mrs. Sanger.</q></p>
			<p><q who="PO">She declares that modern society's attitude toward the unmarried woman is
					a disgrace to civilization. With knowledge given in a wholesome, sensible way
					there would be less immorality, is Mrs. Sanger's opinion.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Censorship Blamed for Ills.</head>
			<p>“There is altogether too much censorship,”<q who="PO"> said “the women
				rebel.</q>”</p>
			<p><q who="PO">The system of censorship she deems</q> “appalling and a menace to
				liberty.”</p>
			<p>“We have censored and suppressed and repressed and all the time we should be getting
				at the foundation--character-building. We wouldn’t be so silly, puritanical and
				narrow if we had a little more common sense.” Mrs. Sanger averred.</p>
			<p>“I don’t want to hitch birth control with any of the isms. I want it to be on a sane
				basis.” This is the one thing she most hopes for, she says. She wants to help women
				to develop her intellectuality, to have some time for the children she has already
				and to do away with the “old fogey” idea that any discussion of out of the ordinary
				topics is “obscene.”</p>
