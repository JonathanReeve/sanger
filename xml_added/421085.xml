				<q who="TH">The need for adopting birth-control methods in the interests of humanity
					at large was stressed by Mrs. Margaret Sanger, addressing a well-attended public
					meeting held at the <place>Paran Square</place>, last evening, under the
					presidentship of Dr. <person reg="Mugaseth, Kobad Dhunjibhai"
					>Mugaseth</person>.</q>
			</p>


			<p>
				<q who="HINDU">The President extended a hearty welcome to Mrs. Sanger on behalf of
					the citizens of Calicut and said that Mrs. Sanger was doing propaganda for the
					last so many years on the need for adopting birth-control methods. They were
					glad to have her among them that day and hear her views on the subject. </q></p>


			<p>
				<q who="HINDU">Mrs. Sanger, in the course of her speech, said that the main reason
					for the controversy about the subject was due to the fact that most of those who
					were opposed to it had misunderstood it. After working for a number of years
					among the people in a slum district of <place reg="New York, NY">New
						York</place>, she came to the conclusion that in the interests of their
					womanhood and country, It was necessary to adopt birth-control methods. She
					firmly believed that if people knew the sufferings of the women at the time of
					child birth, they would do everything possible to help them to gain the
					knowledge of birth-control and make them healthy women. Though the work was in
					progress for the last 21 years, no law had been changed and there was the same
					opposition, intolerance, or bigotry, in all countries, denying the women the
					chance of gaining knowledge which would free them from sickness, poverty, etc.
					Birth-control meant conscious control of the birth-rate by preventing
					conception. After explaining the harm that was being done to the country and
					families by frequent births, she dealt at length on the methods fo rechecking
					frequent pregnancy.</q>

			<p><q who="UN"> Mrs. Margaret Sanger, of the <org
						reg="Birth Control International Information Centre">International
						Information Centre on Birth Control</org>, addressed a large gathering,
					yesterday evening, on birth control, at the Paran Square. Dr. Kh. D. Mugaseth
					presided. </q></p>
			<p><q who="UN"> Dr. Mugaseth, introduced the speaker.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="UN">Mrs. Sanger referred to the condemnation of the birth control propaganda
					and said that <person reg="Stevenson, Robert Louis">Robert Louis
						Stevenson</person> had said</q>
				<q who="STERO">“Condemnation is misunderstanding</q>.”
				<q who="UN">It was not fit to condemn a thing before its various aspects had been
					studied.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="UN">Proceeding Mrs. Sanger said that what birth control meant was the
					control of birth rate and the number of births could be lowered either by
					prevention of birth, or control over birth rate by conscious individual control.
					In the process of preventing birth they were not in any way taking away life. In
					preventing birth there was no interference with life and for that they had to be
					single or unmarried in life.</q>
			</p>
			<p><q who="UN"> In controlling birth they had to use their intelligence to suit their
					needs. To be conscious of their acts and responsibilities necessarily involved
					that they should be free from the animal kingdom, which was impossible in the
					majority of cases.</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				<q who="UN">She emphasized the need for bringing the population under control. She
					could not imagine what the population of <place>India</place> would be after
					hundred years if allowed to go on unchecked. <place>Italy</place> had a large
					population within the last few decades and 25 per cent of their surplus
					population within the last few decades and 25 per cent of her surplus population
					had to emigrate to <place reg="United States">America</place>.</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				<q who="UN">She knew that in India the marriage-able age had been raised but that
					was not enough. Men and women should be allowed to marry only after they had
					reached adolescence, that is, at the age of 23. </q></p>
