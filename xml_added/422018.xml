				<q who="ML">Mrs. Margaret Sanger, of <place reg="New York, NY">New York,</place>
					persecuted for spreading information in the cause of birth control, told her
					story to <place reg="Milwaukee, WI">Milwaukee</place> physicians, club women,
					suffragists and others Thursdsay night, in the gold room of the <org>Hotel
						Wisconsin</org>. Policemen and plain clothes men were on hand but Mrs.
					Sanger was not molested.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"Three hundred thousand babies die every year in the <place>United States</place>
				from poverty and neglect, while 600,000 parents remain in ignorance of how to
				prevent the coming of 300,000 more babies to die of poverty and neglect," <q
					who="ML">said Mrs. Sanger.</q></p>

			<head type="sub">WEALTHY WOMEN KNOW</head>
			<p>"Women of wealth know how to regulate birth and have practiced it for 25 years. The
				government forbids the teaching of this knowledge to the working class, and when the
				patient is poor the doctor religiously abides by the law. Poor women want this
				knowledge just as badly as do their wealthier sisters."</p>
			<p>"Am I to be persecuted, slandered and subjected to all sorts of indignities for
				helping these poor souls while <person reg="Roosevelt, Theodore">Theodore
					Roosevelt</person> can go up and down the land shouting and urging them to have
				larger families? He is not molested--no, he is lauded to the skies. While I, a
				woman, am arrested for preventing my sisters from producing an unlimited supply of
				cannon fodder for munition makers and professional jingoes."</p>
			<p>"Every department in life is open to discussion and research excepting birth, and woe
				unto him who dares explore that forbidden valley! The scientist may go elsewhere at
				his will and bring back to the public the fruits of his research, but no matter how
				pure his motive, or how high his ideal, slander, imprisonment and persecution at the
				hands of our benevolent government await him who dares invade the forbidden valley.
				We are as ignorant of creation as were our primitive ancestors."</p>
			<p>"The arguments of immorality which they use against us are identical with those used
				in the early struggles against higher education for women. That did not make women
				immoral--we are beginning to see that. We are going to have birth control some day,
				and it will make women no more immoral than has higher education."</p>
