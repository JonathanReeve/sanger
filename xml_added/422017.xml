		<head>Old Loves Best And Second Marriages Are Happiest Says Mrs. Sanger</head>
		<p><q who="UN">Older men make the best lovers.</q></p>
		<p><q who="UN">So says <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger,</person> noted
				advocate of birth control. News of her marriage to <person reg="Slee, J. Noah">J.
					Noah Slee,</person> 62-year-old millionaire, leaked out the other day.</q></p>
		<p><q who="UN">The two were married in 1922, following Mrs. Sanger's return from her world
				tour in the interests of birth control. It had taken just a year and a half of
				eloquent pleading on the part of the elderly millionaire to convince her that she
				could take up the responsibilities of married life again as well as run
				a"cause."</q></p>
		<p><q who="UN">But finally, Mrs. Sanger did say "yes" and now the portrait of a
				good-looking, gray-haired man adorns her desk.</q></p>
		<p>"Second marriages are happiest," <q who="UN">she says,</q> "and older men make the best
			lovers. If you were hunting someone to manage a business wouldn't you want someone with
			experience?</p>
		<p>"American sentiment has always extolled the young love which promises to last forever and
			forever. But love is a growth and a succession of experiences. It is just as foolish to
			promise to live forever as to promise to love forever.</p>
		<p>"A man who has given his early years to building up a career is hungry for romance. Every
			woman is hungry for romance-far, far more than any man suspects. There is more chance of
			her having the hunger satisfied by an older man than by a younger man.</p>
		<p>"An older man has experience back of him. A young man has only book ideals to guide him.
			He suffers disillusionment when he gets another person within four walls and sees that
			she isn't behaving according to any of the rules."</p>
