		<head>BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC PLANNED</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>"Although I am not ready to state the details, it is practically settled that <place
					reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</place> will have a birth control clinic located in
				the stockyards district, where poor women who desire information regarding this
				subject may be accommodated," <q who="CH">declared Mrs. Margaret Sanger, the birth
					control propagandist, to the <org reg="Chicago Herald">HERALD</org> last
					night.</q></p>
			<p>"I am delighted beyond measure at the reception I have received in Chicago, and at
				the interest manifested by people of all classes in this great subject. I have been
				fairly swamped with letters from women with large families, and others not in a
				position to rear any more children at present, requesting literature that will aid
				them in the matter of birth control. I take this as a sign the women of <place
					reg="United States">America</place> are awakening to the fact that in birth
				control lies the solution of many of the social evils and problems that confront
				this nation."</p>

			<head type="sub">WHAT WOMEN WRITE.</head>
			<p><q who="CH">Here are some interesting excerpts from a few of the scores of similar letters
					from women received by Mrs. Sanger:</q></p>
			<p>"<q who="UNK">I am a young married woman, 23 years of age. I have a considerate and
					good husband and the dearest little 30-month-old boy. I would like to know a
					safe and legitimate manner of controlling the size of my family. I wish to have
					more children, but for a year or two I will not be in condition physically or
					financially to bear or educate more children. At the same time I wish to be as
					nearly a perfect mother, wife and loving companion as it is possible for a woman
			to be.</q>"</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">ASKS FOR INFORMATION.</head>
			<p>"<q who="UNK">"Please tell me about this birth control, for I had a bad case with my
					first baby and would not like to have them come very close. I want more than
					one, but far apart. I am 20 years old.</q>"</p>
			<p><q who="UNK">"I believe your work is worthy of the respect and help of all thoughtful
					people, and that general knowledge of birth control will produce a better
					generation."</q></p>
