		<p>I <del>believe</del> know that all of you must agree with me in my belief that such calm,
			dispassionate research as Dr. Bocker's <del>work</del>
			<add>statement</add> reveals will do much to awaken not only the interest and respect of
			the people of the community but to awaken and stimulate the interest of other scientists
			and physicians in the medical aspects of birth control.</p>
		<p>Now I think that this is the most appropriate moment to announce a further victory for
			the <org>American Birth Control League</org>. I consider it a distinct victory to be
			able to announce to you tonight that the <org
				reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 6th">6th
				International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference</org> is to be held here
			in <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> next March. This follows on the highly
			successful conferences held in <org reg="International Neo-Malthusian Conference, 1st"
					><place reg="Paris, France">Paris</place> in 1901</org>, in <org
				reg="International Neo-Malthusian Conference, 2nd"><place reg="Liege, Belgium"
					>Liege</place> in 1905</org>, the <org
				reg="International Neo-Malthusian Conference, 3rd"><place reg="Hague, Netherlands"
					>Hague</place> in 1910</org>, in <org
				reg="International Neo-Malthusian Conference, 4th"><place reg="Dresden, Germany"
					>Dresden</place>, 1911</org> and <org
				reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 5th"><place
					reg="London, United Kingdom">London</place> 1922</org>.</p>
		<p>For the first time in its history the foremost authorities on the problems of population
			are coming from every civilized country of the world as our guests.</p>
		<p>All of you who have shown your interest in this subject by coming here tonight may take
			advantage of this great educational opportunity to see and hear our eminent speakers in
			the various sessions.</p>
		<p>We have already invited a large number of men preeminent in their chosen fields*- men
			like <person reg="Keynes, John Maynard">John Maynard Keynes</person>, the economist, Sir
				<person reg="Lankester, Edwin Ray">Ray Lankester</person>, the great English
			scientist; Lord <person reg="Buckmaster, Stanley">Buckmaster</person>, probably the
			finest legal mind in <place>Great Britain</place>; Professor <person
				reg="MacBride, Ernest William">MacBride</person> the well known biologist of <org
				reg="University of London">London University</org>; <person
				reg="Westermarck, Edward">Edward Westermarck</person>, renowned as a profound
			student of the institution of marriage; men like <person reg="Wells, H. G.">H. G.
				Wells</person>, <person reg="Shaw, George Bernard">Bernard Shaw</person> and <person
				reg="Bennett, Arnold">Arnold Bennett</person>. There are already acceptances of
			delegates from <place>Hungary</place>, <place>Austria</place>, <place>Germany</place>,
				<place>France</place> from the <place reg="Asia">Orient</place>,
				<place>India</place>, and <place>Japan</place>.</p>
		<p>The sessions during these five days will be a sort of temporary university on all the
			deep problems of civilization- opening new vistas into the whole future of the human
			race. Nothing so wide in its scope has ever happened in this country before.</p>
		<p>But I am taking time from our next speaker who is going to tell you something of the
			legal status of birth control. He will also tell you something more of this conference
			and how we can all cooperate to make it a great success in the eyes of the world. It
			gives me real pleasure to introduce to you Mr. <person reg="Thurman, I. N.">I. N.
				Thurman</person>.</p>
