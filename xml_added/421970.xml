		<head>Birth Control Leader Finds Japan Receptive</head>
		<p>
			<q who="HA">The woman who coined the phrase "birth control" broke a
				centuries old precedent in <place>Japan</place> a few days
				ago.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HA">She is Mrs. Margaret Sanger Slee, president of the
					<org>International Planned Parenthood Federation</org>. Mrs.
				Slee arrived in <place reg="Honolulu, HI">Honolulu</place> by
					<org>Japan Air Lines</org> late Tuesday.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HA">On April 15, she stood in the old House of Peers, now
				the <org reg="Japan House of Councillors">Japanese House of
					Councillors</org>, to discuss their over population problem.
				The first foreign woman to appear before the <org
					reg="Japan Diet">Diet</org>, Mrs. Sanger said she was
				enthusiastically received.</q>
		</p>
		<div>
			<p>"Even the disturbance and criticism caused by the H-bomb
				explosion did not interfere with my work,"<q who="HA"> Mrs. Slee
					said at the <org>Moana Hotel</org> yesterday.</q> "But you
				can feel the attitude of the Japanese in the press and the
				personal questions put to me.</p>
			<p>"In the House of Councillors, the Japanese wanted to know why
				Americans did not protest to <org reg="United States Government"
					>their government</org> the H-bomb experiments. They
				countered with "the British are protesting to their <org
					reg="United Kingdom Parliament">parliament</org>, why don't
				you?"</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<q who="HA">Mrs. Slee made the air journey to Japan accompanied
					by her secretary-interpreter, Mrs.<person reg="Hata, Chieko"
						> Chieko Hata</person> of <place reg="New York, NY">New
						York</place>. The purpose, to consult with leaders of
					the Planned Parenthood movement to see if Japan is strong
					enough nationally for Mrs. Slee, as president, to accept the
					invitation for the October, 1955, international meeting.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HA">What they lack in organization, the Japanese make up
					in sympathy and enthusiasm. Mrs. Slee has approved the <org
						reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 5th"
						>international conference</org> in Japan.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<q who="HA">As she stood in the House of Councillors, Mrs. Slee
					said the questions flew thick and fast. The flash bulbs
					popped in the hands of at least 20 photographers. They
					represented English as well as Japanese newspapers.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"It was like Hollywood," <q who="HA">the dynamic little birth
					control banner carrier said.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="HA">For two and one half hours the questions came, not
					only from one man, but from the women. One, also a midwife,
					said she spoke for 30,000 other Japanese midwives. She
					sought information on setting up clinics, how they were
					financed, was knowledge available to everyone?</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>A question was posed by one man. </p>
			<p>
				<q who="HA">"<q who="UNK">Is religion a barrier in this
						movement?</q>" he queried.</q>
			</p>
			<p><q who="HA">Mrs. Slee said she gave a lengthy answer to this one.
					She told them that </q>"<name type="deity">God</name> gave
				us intelligence and it is the responsibility of every adult man
				and woman to use this intelligence. Our first responsibility is
				when man creates a child and brings it into the world."</p>
			<p>"They seemed pleased with this answer," <q who="HA">Mrs. Slee
					said.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><q who="HA">Another councillor said he considered population
					Japan's most pertinent problem and asked </q>"<q who="UNK"
					>advice from an expert.</q>"</p>
			<p>"I told them the whole movement has moved into the medical,
				public health, welfare, demography, and laboratory field. There
				is no need for Japan to have 100 million people in 10 years as
				prophesied. The answer lies in individual instruction as in the
				three villages used for demonstration purposes."</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				<q who="HA">Mrs. Slee said that 1,300,000 babies were born in
					Japan last year, but at least 1,500,000 women submitted to
					abortions. A eugenic law passed in Japan during the
					occupation permits abortion as well as the use of
					contraceptives. Mrs. Slee hopes that education will lessen
					the need for such clinics, to improve the humane aspect as
					well as material health.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HA">The population expert attended a meeting of 800
					Japanese women in <place reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokyo</place>'s
					vast <org reg="Hibaya Hall">Hibiya hall</org>. She heard
					them discuss their lot under their new status.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>"They are proud of the advances gained since 1947 when centuries
				of tradition were swept aside and Japanese women were placed, at
				least legally, on the same footing with their men. They have
				made great strides, particularly in education, in the spread of
				women's suffrage. Now we hope to have their help in our work in
				population control." <q who="HA">Mrs. Slee said.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HA">She remains here until May 6, when she flies to
						<place reg="San Francisco, CA">San Francisco</place> to
					meet with <place>California</place> groups who have
					organized under <org
						reg="California State Federation of Birth Control Leagues"
						>Planned Parenthood</org>.</q>
