		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="AG">There will never be world peace until birth control is practiced on a
					world-wide basis, Mrs. Margaret Sanger of <place reg="New York, NY">New York
						city</place>, honorary chairman of the <org
						reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned Parenthood
						Federation</org>, said here yesterday. She stopped in Little Rock to check
					on the birth control clinic here and to renew acquaintances with <person
						reg="Cornish, Hilda Kahlert">Mrs. Ed Cornish</person>, 4816 Country Club
					boulevard.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="AG">Birth control practices need to be taught in <place>Germany</place> and
						<place>Japan </place>to prevent the two countries from continuing to be the
					spawning grounds of wars, Mrs. Sanger said. "Women of Japan have requested
					permission from <person reg="MacArthur, Douglas">General MacArthur</person> for
					me to come there and install birth control centers," she said.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="AG">Mrs. Sanger also is director of the world's largest <org
						reg="Margaret Sanger Research Bureau">birth control research clinic</org>
					located in New York city.</q>

			<p>
				<q who="AG">She said the federation has a three-fold purpose: To teach contraceptive
					practices, to aid sterility cases and to conduct marriage counselling services.
					Aiding sterility cases is a new program of the federation, Mrs. Sanger said.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"Our organization is not opposed to people having children,"<q who="AG"> she
					explained.</q> "What we want to do is to teach family spacing," she said.
				Children should be spaced at least two to three years apart to give the mother a
				chance to rear the child and to give her a chance to recover completely from the
				previous birth."</p>
			<p><q who="AG">Marriage counseling service is given to aid men returning from the war
					who find that home is not what it used to be, she said.,</q> "We try to prevent
				them from winding up in a divorce court by aiding in their readjustment,"<q who="AG"
					> she said.</q> "We aid them not by psychiatry but by applying plain common
				sense."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="AG">She became interested in birth control problems in 1916 and helped to
					organize the national federation that now has 630 chapters. Mrs. Sanger was last
					in Little Rock in 1940 and spoke at a meeting here in 1939. She and Mrs. Cornish
					have been friends since their <person reg="Sanger, Stuart">sons</person>
					attended <org>Yale University</org> together. Mrs. Cornish has been affiliated
					with the federation since 1931 and now is chairman of the state
					organization.</q>
