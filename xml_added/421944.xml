		<head>Mineola Fair Cancels Birth Control Exhibit</head>
		<head type="sub">Mrs. Sanger Assails Ban</head>
		<p><q who="NYHT">Meanwhile, Mrs. Margaret Sanger, pioneer advocate of birth control
				education and chairman of the <org>Birth Control Federation of America</org>, <place
					reg="New York, NY">501 Madison Avenue</place>, issued a statement bitterly
				attacking <person reg="Poletti, Charles">Mr. Poletti</person>’s action as
			</q>“absurd” and indicating “how misinformed” <q who="NYHT">he is </q>“in this field of
			public health.” <q who="NYHT">She urged citizens of the state to demand a review of the
				case and a reconsideration of the ban, saying that</q> “it is important to the
			welfare of the citizens of <place>New York</place> State” <q who="NYHT">that Mr.
				Poletti’s action be rescinded</q>.</p>
		<p><q who="NYHT">Noting that Mr. Poletti had ruled that the planned exhibit was</q>
			<q who="POLCH">“calculated to contravene or change the declared policy of the state
				under <name type="law" reg="New York State Criminial Code, Section 1145">S1145 of
					the state law</name></q>,” <q who="NYHT">Mrs. Sanger said: </q></p>
		<p>“As far back as 1918, <person reg="Crane, Frederick">Judge Crane</person>, in his
			memorable decision, pointed out at that S1145 of the New York State laws specifically
			exempts physicians from the restrictions of <name type="law"
				reg="New York State Criminial Code, Section 1142">S1142</name> which Mr. Poletti
			cites, and recognizes the right of the medical profession to provide contraceptives ‘for
			the cure or prevention of disease.’</p>

		<p> “Such an exemption is all what birth control advocates have ever sought from restrictive
			laws, so obviously there is no need to attempt to amend existing New York State laws, or
			to urge any change in the existing policy which Mr. Poletti mentioned. </p>
		<p>“In 1936 a similar interpretation of the <org reg="United States Government"
				>Federal</org> law also recognized the right of the medical profession to provide
			contraceptives ‘to promote the health or well-being of their patients,’ and therefore
			there has been no need for any legislative effort of any kind to be carried on by the
			Birth Control Federation of America, Inc., at this time. </p>
		<p>“We have been informed that Mr. Poletti’s stand was taken as a result of protests by
			representatives of the <org>Roman Catholic Church</org>. </p>
		<p>“If this be so, we protest as undemocratic and inimical to public welfare the fact that
			pressure of a minority religious group can effectively the majority if the citizens of
			New York State from information they desire on a subject considered of sufficient
			importance as a health measure to be included in the State Public Health programs of
				<place reg="North Carolina">North</place> and <place>South Carolina</place> and of
				<place>Alabama</place> and in 209 health department programs in thirty-nine states.” </p>
		<p>
			<q who="NYHT">Mrs. Sanger said that the exhibits simply would have informed the public
				of the benefits of birth control by graphically calling attention to the advantages
				of planned families so that more families might avail themselves of services and
				advice physicians are legally entitled to give.</q>
