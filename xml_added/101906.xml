		<head>The Control of Parenthood: A Review by Margaret Sanger</head>
		<p>The book entitled: "<title type="book">The Control of Parenthood;</title>" edited by Mr.
				<person reg="Marchant, James">James Marchant</person>, with an introduction by the
				<person reg="Wakefield, Henry Russell">Bishop of Birmingham</person>, contains an
			excellent study of the population question. It brings together the opinions of several
			of the most distinguished Englishmen and women who are experts in their own particular
			subject. They here present with great care the various aspects of this century-old
			controversial subject. It is one of the few books in which the arguments for and against
			the conscious control of Parenthood are given. The subject is treated from the
			biological, economic, social, religious, Imperial and racial aspects, and at least two
			authorities are chosen to present or refute each of these. The argument by Sir <person
				reg="Haggard, H. Rider">Rider Haggard</person> for the dominance of the <place
				reg="Great Britain">British Empire</place> by increase of population, is most ably
			answered by Mr. <person reg="Cox, Harold">Harold Cox</person> in his essay on the
			economic side of the subject. Altogether the book is the best and clearest presentation
			of the subject in the English language. </p>
