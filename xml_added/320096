<head type="sub">To Start Big Open Air Campaign.   Will Distribute 20,000 Leaflets on <person reg="Ettor, Joseph">Ettor</person>&hyphen;<person reg="Giovannitti, Arturo">Giovannitti</person> Case.</head>
<p>The Lawrence Defense Conference met Thursday, June 6, at the Labor Temple.  <person>Sol Bromberg </person>was elected chairman.  A motion that the Executive Committee of this
conference be requested to meet every Thursday hereafter, also that they act immediately and
make arrangements for open air meetings, was carried.</p>
<p>The leaflet which the conference requested <person>Moses Oppenheimer</person> to
write, covering the case of Ettor and Giovannitti, was read and accepted.  The Executive
Committee ordered 20,000 to be printed at once.  </p>
<p>A motion made and carried that the secretary write to the Lawrence Defense Committee at <place reg="Lawrence, MA">Lawrence</place> informing them of this conference and requesting them not to send
subscription lists to various organizations in <place>New York City</place>, but to send lists
to this conference.</p>
<p>Delegates from <org>the first Russian Branch of the Socialist party</org>, also <org>Branch 1, Socialist party</org>, were seated.</p>
<p>Delegates for <org reg="Local 179, Industrial Workers of the World">Local 179,  I. W. W.</org>, reported that the local is making
arrangements for a monster protest meeting, together with all affiliated unions.</p>
<p>On Saturday, June 15, 3 p.m., there will be an open air meeting at Union Square.  Speakers <person>Edward F. Cassidy</person>, <person>F. Sumner Boyd</person>, <person>Jacob Panken</person>, <person>Jean J. Coronel</person>, <person>Thomas Flynn</person> and <person>J. Breen</person>.  Meetings will be held at this place every Saturday
afternoon until after the trial of Ettor and Giovannitti.</p>
<p>On account of the party meeting on the same evening many delegates of the conference
were not present.  It is hoped that at the next regular meeting, June 20, all delegates will attend
and other organizations which have not yet sent delegates to this conference are urged to do so. 
The time is drawing near for the trial, and there is much work to be done.</p>
<p>Speak up, Comrades: get your organizations to send delegates here at the next meeting and
let us all together make such a noise that the workers of the country will awaken to the
outrageous crime committed against them before it is too late.</p>
