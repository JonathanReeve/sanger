			<emph rend="italics">(continued from June Issue)</emph>
		</p>
		<p>We have pointed out that <person reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert"> Malthus,</person>
			discoverer of the theory of population and the precursor of the Darwinian theory of
			evolution, advocated as preventive checks upon overpopulation, "<q who="MALTH">moral
				restraint</q>" and very late marriage. His knowledge of human instincts was limited.
			Malthus proposed "<q who="MALTH">moral restraint,</q>" abstention as long as possible
			from sexual intercourse, or so late a marriage that between the marriageable age and
			that of the critical period of the woman (the time of the cessation of menstruation)
			that it would be impossible for her to bear very many children. This is in the narrow
			sense Malthusianism. The Neo-Malthusians very quickly saw that this was impractical and
			productive of much unhappiness and misery. The sociological doctrine became a
			psychological one. Restraint with the direst and most unfortunate of consequences, both
			psychological and physiological, to the individual and to the race. Although advocated
			by the Church fathers, continence and celibacy had never been practiced by the masses of
			the Occidental world. But in thus driving sex expression into underground and secret
			channels, prostitution and its train of evils, diseases and insanity became firmly
			entrenched institutions of the western world.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, the spirit of Malthus' own reform stopped at marriage. He was radical
			enough in interposing difficulties between the desire to marry and actual marriage; but
			when a man and woman were once married, he did not presume to counsel sexual restraint.
			But from other quarters the theory was soon carried to its logical and serviceable
			conclusion. In the supplement to the <title type="book">Encyclopedia Britannica</title>
			published in 1818, <person reg="Mill, James">James Mill</person> wrote that it was time
			to "<q who="MILJA">discard the superstitions of the nursery</q>" and in his "<title
				type="book">Elements of Political Economy</title>" (1821) he concluded "<q
				who="MILJA">The grand practical problem is . . . to find means of limiting the
				number of births</q>."</p>
		<p>Answers to this question were almost immediately forthcoming. In 1823 was published the
			so-called "diabolical handbill" addressed "<title type="article">To the Married of Both
				Sexes,</title>" and setting forth the economic disadvantages of excessively large
			families. From this time to the present, advocates of Birth Control have published,
			throughout <place>Europe</place> and <place reg="United States"> America</place>,
			various handbooks and pamphlets giving explicit directions to men and women of the
			physiological and practical aspects of family limitation. These directions have been
			made up, partially upon the basis of scientific investigation and partially upon the
			traditional practices of people which have, notably in <place>France</place>, proved to
			be expedient and serviceable.</p>
		<p>But the great advance has been made since the discovery by <unclear resp="MSPP"><person
					reg="Pasteur, Louis">Pasteur</person></unclear> of the germ theory, in the
			latter half of the nineteenth century. Applied to Birth Control, the germ theory of life
			gave rise to the practice of Spermaticide, the name to those preparations destined to
			sterilize the male cells (<emph rend="italics">spermatozoa</emph>). But the question has
			often been asked: Is there a perfect or safe method of prevention of conception? Such a
			method should combine the following conditions: (1) It should depend exclusively upon
			the woman; (2) it should cause neither the man nor the woman any inconvenience; (3) it
			should be absolutely certain and dependable; (4) it should cost very little.</p>
		<p>Let us answer this question at the outset. There is no magic method, no perfect method of
			preventing conception, that does not require care and attention. But the experience of
			the movement in Europe and America has shown us that this is partially due to the
			ignorance and inertia of the medical profession, many of whom profit largely by the
			practice of abortion, and many of whom do not wish to give to women a much needed
			education in sexual prophylaxis. Women are thus thrown back, for the source of their
			knowledge in these matters, upon neighbors and friends. Here they receive numbers of
			conflicting suggestions, each presented in an unscientific and unhygienic fashion.
			Altogether this is very disturbing and confusing to the poor woman whose ideas on sexual
			hygiene are of the most primitive, and who is living in constant fear of pregnancy.</p>
		<p>It is on account of this confusion that the best authorities in Europe and America have
			decided that the greatest present need is for Birth Control clinics in all of the poorer
			sections of our cities, where all the women may receive safe and sane instruction in all
			matters of personal hygiene, so that they may protect themselves from unwanted
			pregnancy. </p>
		<p>Our Occidental world has come to see that <q who="FRABE"> "an ounce of prevention is
				worth a pound of cure</q>." The great weapons of prevention, in the battle against
			infectious and contagious diseases, are hygiene and sanitation. Contagious and
			infectious diseases breed and propagate their disastrous deaths in the soul of filth and
			overcrowding. A stifled, weakened, undernourished, dirty group of humans is the very
			breeding ground of the great racial scourges, such as tuberculosis, typhus, typhoid,
			venereal maladies, trachoma, as well as the lesser contagions. Most of these evils, or
			the predisposition to them (<emph rend="italics">diathesis</emph>), are heritable; and
			it is precisely among the children of the crowded unsanitary filthy slums, in all parts
			of the world, that these great scourges are enabled to propagate and perpetuate their
			curse. </p>
		<p>The only means of preventing, of uprooting, is by sanitation and personal hygiene, <emph
				rend="italics">and by reducing the birth rate among the carriers of transmissible
				and heritable diseases</emph>. A great Dutch authority, Dr. <person
				reg="Rutgers, Johannes">Rutgers</person>, has pointed out that personal hygiene, so
			essential to the well-being of the individual and the community, is practically
			equivalent with preventative methods of Birth Control. In answer to the contention that
			mechanical devices and antiseptic fluids are provocative of irritation to the mucus
			membranes, the same objection might be made of the hygienic care of the teeth, yet we
			realize that the proper care of the teeth is an absolute essential to health. Ever
			increasing numbers of civilized men and women today are wearing "mechanical devices" in
			their mouths and are daily, and even more frequently, washing out their mouths with
			fluids that are sometimes identical with, and often even stronger than, those employed
			for Birth Control. Yet such precautions are not considered "immoral" or "unnatural."</p>
		<p>Incontrovertible figures and statistics, of the most definite and exact precision, drive
			us to the conclusion that filth, unsanitary conditions, and infectious diseases, are the
			inevitable companions of large families and numerous children. It is no less true that
			cleanliness, personal hygiene, and sanitary surroundings go hand in hand with birth
			control and fewer children. We also learn that these fewer and cleaner children are not
			so often victims of diseases that increase the infant mortality rate among the less
			fortunate.</p>
		<p>It is more imperative than ever that women should now be taught the great necessity of
			personal hygiene and cleanliness. This is the only safe way to prevent the transmission
			of the venereal diseases and to avoid unwanted children. </p>
		<p>In approaching the great problem of hygiene and sanitation through the agency of Birth
			Control clinics, the great advantage is that we are thus enabled to offer poor and
			unfortunate women immediate relief and to begin their education in sex and personal
			hygiene and prophylaxis upon the great fundamental basis of their own personal needs and
			interests; thus ours is a campaign not imposed from without or above, not a charity nor
			a philanthropy, but the one inevitable answer to a crying demand. It helps the woman to
			help herself. And more than any other scheme or program or policy for social and world
			betterment, it is truly <emph rend="italics">preventive</emph> of the evils of the
			world. It does not make two evils grow when one grew before; but it is the only safe and
			certain way to eradicate social evils at their very root. </p>
		<p>Such clinics as these, which have, as I have tried to show, so brilliantly proved their
			value in <place reg="Netherlands">Holland</place>, are of the greatest necessity to our
			Western civilization, even in countries like France where an effort is being made to
			remedy the losses of the war by repopulation. Their function would be to substitute
			scientific Birth Control in place of the devastating practice of abortion and that
			inevitable result of bringing unwanted children into the world--the high rate of infant
			mortality. </p>
		<p> When one <unclear rend="MSPP"><person reg="Taussig, Frederick">eminent
					authority</person></unclear> informs us that there are at least one million
			abortions performed every year in the United States of America, and others place the
			figure even higher, when even the <org reg="United States Government">Government of the
				United States</org> points to an inordinately high death rate among children, we are
			able to understand that scientific Birth Control, aiming to prevent the dangers and the
			deaths from this cause, is truly hygienic and eugenic in its aim. While the women of the
			wealthy classes are permitted by their physicians to use Birth Control, the poorer
			women, in order to escape a forced maternity, are forced to seek relief in abortion.
			Despite the fact that abortion is forbidden by law in the United States, there are very
			few prosecutions of midwives and physicians who practice it. Moralists and authorities
			close their eyes to this practice, so universally practiced is it, though with great
			risks to life and health. </p>
		<p>Thus the question is reduced in America not to whether family limitation should be
			practiced. It is practiced, by fair means or foul. It explains to a large extent the
			large number of maternal deaths. The problem that American society must solve is this:
			Shall family limitation be attained through abortion or through Birth Control? Shall
			normal, safe scientific methods be employed, or shall women be forced to continue to
			resort to dangerous, surgical operations, often performed in the most dangerous
			circumstances? In view of the permanent injuries that often result from abortion –
			hemorrhage, sepsis, tetanus, perforation of the uterus, as well in many cases of
			sterility, anemia, malignant diseases, displacement, neurosis, endometritus,-–there can
			be but one logical and sane answer to these questions. As a great medical authority, Dr.
				<person reg="Hirsch, Max">Max Hirsch </person> puts the question: "<q who="HIRMA">He
				who would combat abortion and at the same time combat Birth Control may be likened
				to the person who would fight contagious diseases and at the same time forbid
				disinfection. For contraceptive measures are important weapons in the fight against
				abortion. America has had since 1873 a law which prohibits by criminal statute the
				distribution and regulation of contraceptive measures. It follows, therefore, that
				America stands at the head of all nations in the huge number of abortions</q>."</p>
		<p>Infanticide and abandonment are likewise the result of the present enforced restrictions.
			Orphan asylums, organized charities, foundling homes, are becoming a great and greater
			drain upon the resources of the American public; while practically nothing is done to
			check the fertility of the feeble-minded and the insane. Not merely from the standpoint
			of personal and family hygiene, but from that of the well-being of the nation, Birth
			Control is an imperative necessity at the present moment.</p>
		<p>From the point of view of the coming generation, that is of the future of the nation and
			the race, the practice of Birth Control more than justifies itself. In every country of
			Europe and America in which investigations have been made, it has been shown that
			children born into large families have less chance of survival, of becoming the men and
			women of tomorrow, than the children born into small families. It has been discovered
			that children should be spaced out. If a woman submits to a rapid and successive series
			of pregnancies without a sufficient interval between to recuperate and recover her
			strength, her weakened constitution and physical debility react unfavorably upon her
			children. Even from the economic point of view, the large family is more apt to be
			underfed and undernourished. In the creation of a great new race, the first essential is
			the development of strong healthy mothers.</p>
		<p>It is not merely theory, but carefully tested facts, which indicate for us the close
			interrelationship between uncontrolled fecundity and misery. The salary of the worker is
			not apportioned according to the number of mouths he has to feed. One more child in the
			family is an added burden to the shoulders of all. To keep up the home, the father and
			mother are forced to work harder. The elder children are forced out to work also at a
			much earlier age. The home becomes more and more neglected, and the younger children are
			more and more neglected, particularly as they come into the world as the penalty of
			ignorance. It is from such families as these that we recruit our dependent classes, our
			paupers and our criminals, who fill the various institutions or are the endless subjects
			of charities--thus consuming wealth that should go to the enhancement and advancement of
			human life.</p>
