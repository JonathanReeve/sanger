		</epigraph>
		<p>Although it is only in the last few years that the doctrine of Birth Control has assumed
			the proportions of a definitely crystallized world movement, its history is ancient.
			This history began with the first crude efforts to control and direct the human
			reproduction. This custom of infanticide, a custom practiced in certain portions of the
			globe even today, was the first crude and barbarous expression of a dim realization that
			instinct must in some way be made to subserve intelligent adaptation. The next step
			toward conscious control of population was the practice of abortion. It is unnecessary
			here to go into the history of this cruel and barbarous practice. Physicians even today
			are brought sufficiently into contact with the dangers and the frightful cost of this
			emergency measure, which still remains, among large sections of the world's population,
			the only method of control over the great overwhelming power of the procreative
			instincts. Birth Control, as it is understood by all intelligent students today, means
			the substitution of scientific contraception of a sanitary and harmless nature for the
			costly, cruel and often fatal customs of infanticide and abortion. </p>
		<p>The World War has concentrated interest in and thrown new light on the complex problems
			of population, of racial conflicts, as well as upon the qualitative analysis of human
			intelligence. A large and distinguished body of social and economic thinkers are coming
			to realize that the complex economic and political problems which confront human society
			today are organically bound up with the question of Birth Control. But in thus
			emphasizing the larger aspects of this program, we should never forget that actual
			progress is impossible without the cooperation and the guidance of, the scientist and
			the physician. </p>
		<p>The program for Birth Control parallels recent developments in the sphere of medicine. In
			the war against disease and epidemic, prevention and sanitation are now recognized as
			the only adequate weapons. Undoubtedly for many years to come the majority of physicians
			and surgeons must direct their energies to individual cases of disease. But because this
			is their task, a task requiring a vast fund of fortitude and patience, it would be an
			error to suppose that the role of the physician in society should be limited to the care
			and cure of the diseased and ailing. His is a vastly more important role. His sphere is
			by no means limited to the mere amelioration of human suffering; it embraces the whole
			of life, health as well as disease. Individual and racial health, as every day we are
			coming more intensely to realize, has its own laws and structure--laws as complex, as
			deeply rooted, and as worthy of investigation as those of disease. In our more
			superficially humanitarian efforts we have perhaps not realized until very recently,
			that the prevention of disease is dependent upon broadly based programs of social
			hygiene and racial prophylaxis. When laymen, as well as physicians, awaken to the fact
			that disease is not a matter of chance occurrence, but is closely related to every
			manifestation of life, the pivotal importance of the physician to every human being, in
			health as in illness, will be recognized. The day is not far distant let us hope, when
			the doctor, armed with the intimate knowledge of every phase of the human constitution,
			and standing with the calm authority of far-seeing vision, may be acclaimed, rather than
			the priest, the politician or the warrior, as the only true leader competent to show
			suffering humanity the path out of its vale of tears. For today only to the physician is
			afforded a view of man as a biological organism. If the physician be possessed of the
			"divine curiosity" of Science, he comes to the realization that the greatest menace to
			the health of humanity is found not in those dire epidemic of infectious or contagious
			diseases that may cut down whole communities, calamitous as these seem. The direct
			menaces is to be found in the heritable maladies and defects which are handed down to
			generation after generation, and manifest themselves in myriad forms. Thus syphilis
			allies itself with feeble-mindedness. And mental defect, wearing the mask of
			delinquency, pauperism, prostitution and crime, renders almost impossible the Herculean
			task of attaining racial health. Our poorhouses, our prisons, our asylums for the
			feeble-minded, all have a common <emph rend="italics"> biological</emph> root. Crime is
			not merely a matter of law. It has a physiological history. A faulty heredity, a
			defective germ plasm, a biological or physiological imperfection of the nervous and
			endocrine system--these lie at the root of most of our social and racial problems.</p>
		<p>It has been the realization of these truths that has enlisted most of the physicians and
			scientists of other countries who have challenged conservative opinion by bravely
			championing the cause of Birth Control. This movement is by means of propaganda of
			extremists who are seeking to tell physicians and doctors their duty. On the contrary,
			from the earliest days of the Neo-Malthusian agitation it has been inspired and directed
			by physicians who had the clear vision that enabled them to look beyond the special
			individual case to the underlying significance. In <place>England</place> those valiant
			pioneer Doctors <person reg="Drysdale, George">George</person> and <person
				reg="Drysdale, Charles R.">Charles R. Drysdale</person> fought for years against the
			momentum of Victorian opinion. In <place reg="Netherlands">Holland</place>, where the
			First Birth Control Clinic in the world was opened in <place
				reg="Amsterdam, Netherlands">Amsterdam </place>in 1881, it has been mainly due to
			the efforts of two physicians, Dr. <person reg="Jacobs, Aletta">Aletta Jacobs</person>
			and Dr. <person reg="Rutgers, Johannes">J. Rutgers</person> that we have that splendid
			example of what the practice of Birth Control and the establishment of clinics under the
			direction of trained specialists may accomplish for a nation.</p>
		<p>At the present moment, <place>England</place> offers a brilliant illustration of the
			interest of physicians in the problem of Birth Control. The sensational address on
				"<title type="book">Married Love</title>" of <person reg="Dawson, Bertrand E.">Lord
				Dawson</person>, the <person reg="George V (England)">King</person>'s physician, at
			the <org>Lambeth Conference of the Bishop of the Church of England</org>, in which he
			defended the practice of Birth Control, is one outstanding instance. At the Fifth
				International Congress on Birth Control held in <place reg="London, England"
				>London</place>last summer, the Contraceptive Section, held for doctors and medical
			students only, under the presidency of Dr. <person reg="Haire, Norman">Norman
				Haire</person>, illustrated the growing adherence of British physicians to the
			movement. It was attended by no less than 164 medical men and women, including Lord
			Dawson and Sir <person reg="Lane, William Arbuthnot">Arbuthnot Lane</person>, who, with
			the exception of only three dissenters, passed this resolution:</p>
		<p>"<q who="INMBC5">That this meeting of the medical members of the <org
					reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 5th">Fifth
					International Neo-Malthusian and Birth control Conference</org> wishes to point
				out that Birth control by hygienic contraceptive devices is absolutely distinct from
				abortion in its physiological, legal and moral aspects. It further records its
				opinion that there is no evidence that the best contraceptive methods are injurious
				to health or conducive to sterility.</q>"</p>
		<p>Similarly, the Medical Section, held under the presidency of Dr. <person
				reg="Millard, Charles Killick">C. Killick Millard</person>, unanimously passed the
			following resolution: </p>
		<p>"<q who="INMBC5"> That this meeting of the Fifth International Neo-Malthusian and Birth
				Control Conference, consisting chiefly of members of the British medial profession,
				considers that it is of the greatest importance that the provisions of hygienic
				Birth Control instruction should become part of the recognized duty of the medical
				profession, and that such instruction should especially be given at all hospitals
				and public health centres to which the poorest classes and those suffering from
				hereditary disease or defectiveness apply for help.</q>"</p>
		<p>Previous to the Conference, Dr. Millard had sent a questionnaire to the leading members
			of the British medical profession. From their replies, Dr. Millard reported, it could no
			longer be claimed that the medical profession in <place>Great Britain</place> condemned
			contraceptive methods; but he made a strong plea that the profession should concentrate
			its attention upon this important subject, because, if it continued to be silent, it
			committed to laymen the solution of problems which are legitimately within the sphere of
			its activity. Two of the leading medical journals of Great Britain, the <title
				type="journal">Lancet</title> and the <title type="journal">British Medical
				Journal</title>, devoted much space to the conference, especially the contraceptive
			and medical aspects. The British Medical Journal notes: "<q who="JOUBR">. . .It was
				interesting to observe the way in which people who were sharply divided on other
				subjects found a common meeting place in Birth Control. The matter was pressed to
				the same conclusion from the point of view of the Socialist and the individualist,
				the nationalist and the internationalist. . . .</q>" The <title type="journal"
				>Lancet</title> reported the speeches of Lord Dawson, Sir Arbuthnot Lane, and other
			men eminent in the medical profession. </p>
		<p>But it has not been in the Western world alone that physicians have pioneered the way for
			hygienic Birth Control. In <place>Japan</place>, Dr. <person reg="Ukita, Kezutami"
				>Kezutami Ukita</person>, a decade or so ago, courageously advocated Birth Control,
			in the face of the most powerful militarists of the island empire. Dr. <person
				reg="Kaji, Tokijiro">Tokijiro Kaji</person>, returning from <place>Germany</place>
			and Holland where he had undertaken a technical study of contraception, devised
			appropriate methods for the Japanese. He established a free clinic in <place
				reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokio</place> and finally opened the <org>People's
			Hospital</org>, for the benefit of women of the poorer classes. Only last year the <org
				reg="">Japanese Birth Control Association</org> was organized, with Dr. Kaji as one
			of the four founders.</p>
		<p>It would be unfair not to record here the strong support given to the Birth Control
			Movement in the United States by individual physicians. The scientific and medical
			magazines often contain papers of the greatest importance upon this question, and papers
			are read in the various societies that bear pertinently upon Birth Control.
			Unfortunately the physician too often confines his remarks to his colleagues, and the
			significant truths of his experiences are seldom conveyed to the general public. Thus,
			Dr. <person reg="Yawger, N. S.">N. S. Yawger</person> read a compelling paper before the
				<org>Philadelphia Neurological Society</org> (Foot note: January 27, 1922, <title
				type="journal">N. Y. Med. Jour.</title>, Vol. CXVI, No. 6, p. 334), dealing with an
			epileptic and her sixteen children, a study "<q who="YAWNS"> of a family that was
				rendered distressingly poor through the circumstances of a blind father, and of an
				epileptic mother who scouted race suicide by living up to sixteen pregnancies, who
				clung to all these maternal burdens save one--the tenth conception miscarried--but
				who still ran true to a total of sixteen, by reason of her first effort having
				brought forth twins.</q> Despite the fact that there was no evidence of syphilis
			that the diseases and defects of the unfortunate children do not appear especially to
			have developed upon a leutic basis--only three of the children appeared to have escaped
			the hereditary blight. Dr. Yawger concludes that "<q who="YAWNS"> a small volume could
				be written upon the disorders which will develop among the early descendants of this
				ill-fated family.</q>" Such studies are of the greatest value not merely to the
			medical profession, but to all who have the health of the nation and the race at
			heart--and where else, we may ask, is true patriotism to be found? In the matter of
			breeding out disease and breeding in health, prophylaxis, as a distinguished authority
			asserts, is ninety per cent. of the cure. Until the medical profession, not merely at
			home but in all countries in the world, and the laity under the leadership of medical
			science, realize these fundamental and unchanging truths, we cannot hope to make any
			progress toward the eradication of those monstrous biological diseases, the full terror
			of whose blight we can only realize when we study them through a succession of
			generations, when we study them genetically instead of in the individual patient.</p>
		<p>The profession of medicine stands upon the threshold of a new era in the social organism.
			The physician today is in possession of truths of the most vital importance to the
			community; and it is his duty, as a member of one of the noblest, if not the noblest of
			all professions, to co-operate to the full extent of his ability with Science in
			enlightening the public concerning those necessary <emph rend="italics">
				biological</emph> laws which we must observe or perish.</p>
		<p>In the past, medicine has too often been looked down upon as a plodding prosaic and
			uninteresting profession, secondary in importance to that of the Church, the law, or
			politics. "<q who="DRYGE"> How can the voice of the physician be heard</q>," exclaimed
			George Drysdale, "<q who="DRYGE">if he can urge only the feeble motives of expediency,
				while the moralist and the clergyman have at their command the armory of duty and
				religion, with the array of eternal rewards and punishments, to enforce reverence
				for their precepts?</q>" </p>
		<p>It is because the Birth Control Movement is the only organized current of thought in the
			world today that emphasizes the basic and fundamental place of the physician in the
			community that we urge upon all members of the profession the immediate study of this
			problem in all its aspects. Mere agreement with or assent to the doctrine is not enough.
			The immediate need of the country is technical study and experimentation, and the
			presentation of the results to all parents and parents-to-be. The destiny of the United
			States cannot be founded.</p>
