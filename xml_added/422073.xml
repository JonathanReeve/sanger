		<p>"American husbands are just big babies so far as the welfare of their wives is concerned,
			and therefore most of the converts to birth control are influenced in their decisions by
			the deleterious effect of large families upon the health of their wives," <q who="MTDW">
				Margaret Sanger, of <place reg="New York, NY"> New York</place>, <place
					reg="United States"> America's</place> chief exponent of limitation of births,
				told the <org reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 5th">
					International Birth Control conference</org> today. </q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="MTDW"> Mrs. Sanger, who has just returned from a tour of <place>China</place>
				and <place>Japan</place> said that her Oriental trip had been a great success. The
				only opposition she encountered, she said, was from the military officials in Japan
				and the supporters if the Japanese military party.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"The Japanese military men want a large population for cannon fodder for the war which I
			am convinced is coming," <q who="MTDW"> continued the birth control leader.</q> "It is
			necessary for Japan to find an outlet for her growing population. Everyone in Japan
			talks war. It is obvious why the military men, who are already making preparations for
			this war, want large families."</p>
		<p>
			<q who="MTDW"> Others participating in the conference include <person reg="Wells, H. G."
					>H. G. Wells</person>, the novelist; <person reg="Keynes, John Maynard">John
					Maynard Keynes</person>, British economic expert; Dr. <person
