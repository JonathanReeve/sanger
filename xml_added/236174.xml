		<head>The Next Step</head>
		<byline>The <name reg="United States Penal Code">Penal Laws</name> of the <place>United
				States</place>, which obstruct and prohibit Birth Control, must be amended by the
			united effort of intelligent Americans.</byline>
		<div>
			<p> “<q who="KEIAR">The greatest experiment in race building the world has ever
				seen</q>” – this is the great human drama now unfolding in these United States,
				according to Sir <person reg="Keith, Arthur">Arthur Keith</person>,
					<place>England</place>’s leading anthropologist. Are we going to play a leading
				role in this great racial drama? Are we going to push through to victory? Or are we
				going to sit back content to remain passive spectators of a play which threatens to
				turn into a national tragedy? There can be one answer only: we must act,
				courageously, promptly and in unison. If we refuse, we brand ourselves as lacking
				not only intelligence, but also courage.</p>
			<p> What is the next imperative step confronting us? I can answer this question in two
				words: co-ordination and co-operation. Let me explain why.</p>
			<p> Birth Control does not mean mere contraception. It has two aspects: positive and
				negative. It aims to place in the hands of every potential mother in America the
				power to say yes or no – to decide for herself if and when and how, she shall
				fulfill the function of motherhood. Birth Control will enable a woman to act as a
				free, self-directed, autonomous personality. It will liberate motherhood. For,
				remember, without free mothers we can never produce free and strong children.</p>

			<head type="sub"> Co-ordination and Co-operation Needed</head>
			<p> But this <title>Magna Carta</title> for womankind cannot become operative without
				co-ordination and co-operation. Last May we scored a great victory in <place
					reg="New York, NY">New York City</place> in vindicating the right of the
					<org>Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</org> to function without the
				interference of obstructionists. That right is possible in other states – in
					<place>California</place>, for instance. But due to obsolete statuses written
				into our Federal Penal Code by prudent fanatics, unified action on the part of all
				intelligent and farseeing groups in the United States has been impossible. Therefore
				I say that the first step toward the co-ordination and co-operation of our forces,
				acting as a nation-wide unit can be effected by the removal of the obstacles
				enacted, under the sinister influence of the late <person reg="Comstock, Anthony"
					>Anthony Comstock</person>, into the Federal Penal Code.</p>
			<p> The Federal law not only excludes books or pamphlets containing contraceptive
				information, but it makes it a crime punishable by five years imprisonment or $5,000
				fine, to tell anyone where, or by whom, such information may be given. In other
				words the Federal law makes it a crime for me to write to anyone in California and
				give the address of any doctor or clinic, of which there are over seven legally
				operating under the law of the State of California. Preposterous truly.... The same
				law prohibits the sending of clinical reports to doctors or the interchange of
				records, data or scientific facts regarding the studies made in various localities
				on the technique and methods of contraception. It prohibits the entrance from
					<place>Europe</place> of articles or books or appliances most necessary to
				advance the scientific work of the clinics, and of contraceptive research in the
				United States.</p>
			<p> The Federal laws (Sections <name reg="Section 334 of the United States Penal Code"
					>334</name>, <name reg="Section 396 of the United States Penal Code">396</name>,
					<name reg="Section 511 of the United States Penal Code">511</name>, <name
					reg="Section 512 of the United States Penal Code">512</name>) must be amended,
				to allow medical and scientific books, records and articles to be sent through the
				mails to and from the physicians, and to include the necessary provisions for the
				patients, as well as for druggists, importers and manufacturers.</p>
			<p> The amendment to the Federal law must be secured by a general protest of enlightened
				and intelligent citizens throughout the country. I have the honor to be the Chairman
				of the <org reg="National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control"
					>Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org> (46 West 15th Street,
				New York City) and we invite readers of the <title type="journal">Review</title> to
				participate in this national campaign.</p>
			<p> Here I have only briefly indicated the network of obstructions and obstacles which
				have been created by these Federal statutes. They stand as a veritable barbed wire
				entanglement which we must clear before the American nation can carry to successful
				fulfillment the greatest experiment in race building this world has ever
				witnessed.</p>
			<p> To join in this national campaign is to align oneself with the forces of
				intelligence. This is the most profoundly patriotic act now possible for American
				citizens. It means to play an active part in a great human drama. Here is an
				opportunity to be embraced joyfully, reverentially, religiously. To present a united
				front – valiant, indefatigable and undefeatable, against the powers of prejudice,
				prurience and stupidity – to gain strength by our very solidity, and to march
				joyfully into the future! There is an increased sense of living, more thrills in
				fighting, than the passive critic ever feels. Support the Federal Committee and
				discover this for yourself!</p>
