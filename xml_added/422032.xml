		<p>In December, the <org>American Birth Control League</org> will go to <org
				reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> for the first time with a Birth Control
			Amendment to <rs type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Section 211
				of the Postal Law</rs>. The great work to be done in the Fall will be to put all
			candidates for the <org reg="United States Senate">Senate</org> and <org
				reg="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</org> on
			record for or against the bill before the November election and to follow up those who
			are elected and enlist their active support even before they take their seats in
			Congress. For this we need all the help our members and sympathizers in all states can
			give us. If you want to help, write to the <person reg="Kennedy, Anne"
				>Secretary</person> at the League headquarters, who will send you copies of the bill
			with questionnaire to candidates attached. If you want to help in another way you can
			send a check. A dollar will help, five will make you a member of our <org
				reg="American Birth Control League, Congressional Committee">Congressional
				Committee</org> and ten will bring you our blessings and a monthly report from
				<place reg="Washington, DC">Washington.</place></p>
		<p>Do we still really care whether it is a girl or a boy? Do "<q who="UNK">families consider
				a boy an asset, a girl a liability?</q>" It is hard to believe that great numbers of
			people still feel this way about the relative value of the sexes, and yet the reception
			given by the English press to <person reg="Erskine, Cicely Quicke">Mrs. Montieth
				Erskine's</person> book, <title type="book">"Sex at Choice,"</title> would seem to
			indicate that they do. We have not read Mrs. Erskine's book, it may or may not have any
			value as a contribution to a subject that is now much discussed in scientific circles.
			Mrs. Erskine alone so far claims that she knows the secret of creating male or female,
			but medical science has gone part of the way. It has reached the point of forecasting
			the sex of the unborn child.</p>
		<p><person reg="Fried, Isaac">Dr. Isaac Fried</person> of the <org>Jewish Maternity
				Hospital</org>, <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>, has according to the
				<title type="journal">Medical Review of Reviews</title> been able, by special blood
			test, to judge correctly the sex of many hundred children in utero. That science will
			soon go farther than this is the prediction of the English biologist <person
				reg="Huxley, Julian">Julian Huxley,</person> who states in an interview in the
				<title type="journal">London Daily News</title> that in fifty years the problem of
			sex determination will be solved. He adds however, that this may not be an unmixed
			blessing and "<q who="HUXJU">believes that the result may easily be chaos</q>" unless
			the direction of this power is under scientific control. With sex determination
			Professor Huxley links Birth Control as a subject which scientific bodies should be
			taking seriously, and recommends that "<q who="HUXJU">the controlling of these two very
				powerful factors in human history</q>" should be in the hands of a Medical Research
			Council.</p>
		<p>With science thus set on taking these important matters out of the haphazard control of
			nature, it is interesting to know the latest figures on the proportions of the sexes. In
			the <place>United States</place> (census of 1920) it was 104 males to 100 females. A
			compilation for <place>Europe</place>
			<person reg="Maurel, Dr.">Dr. Maurel</person> has been given recently in the <title
				type="journal"><foreign lang="FRE">Bulletin de L'Academie de
				Medecine</foreign></title> (<place reg="Paris, France">Paris</place>). It shows that
			most European countries since 1865 show an excess of boy babies. In
				<place>France</place> the latest figure is about 102 boys to 100 girls, in some
			other countries the excess is greater. Maurel believes that the age of parents,
			especially of the father, has some influence, since figures from <place>Norway</place>
			show that the younger the father the greater the proportion of boys.</p>
		<p>At the opening of the Sixth Assembly of the <org>League of Nations</org> on September
			7th, <person reg="Painlev&eacute;, Paul">Paul Painleve,</person> the French Premier, who
			delivered the opening address apologized, according to press reports, "<q who="PAIPA"
				>because greater effort for peace had not been put forth</q>" by the League. The way
			to help the peace movement in a fundamental way is still open. It is two years since
			France tried to have information about contraception read into the obscenity laws of the
			nations which are members of the League. The effort was defeated, mainly it is believed
			by the efforts of England, and since then England has gone far toward government support
			of Birth Control. So we may hope that she will soon be added to <place reg="Netherlands"
				>Holland</place> as an active supporter of Birth Control in the League.</p>
		<p>The Roman Catholic opposition in England, forced to try to meet in other ways some of the
			problems demanding Birth Control for their solution, has presented a program for the
			relief of overpopulation. The program, framed by <person reg="Deegan, Fr.">Father
				Deegan</person> of <place reg="Leicester, England">Leicester</place> is given in our
			news from England. With the exception of one item it is based from beginning to end on
			self control.</p>
		<p>This mirage of relief for their miseries&mdash;this program based on emotional
			starvation-is all the greatest of the Christian churches has to offer its children as
			the alternative for Birth Control. The self control which would limit a marriage to a
			reasonable family of, say, three children means that many years of married life must be
			passed in absolute celibacy.</p>
		<p>This church, of any institution in the world, ought to know that such self control is a
			mirage. For more than fifteen hundred years the <org>Roman Catholic Church</org> has
			been trying to enforce celibacy not upon the rank and file, but upon a picked body of
			the honest men in its membership. Its experience is told in one of the great source
			books of medieval history, <person reg="Lea, Henry C.">Henry C. Lea's</person>
			<title type="book">"History of Sacerdotal Celibacy in the Middle Ages</title>."</p>
		<p>The struggle began in the fourth century when the Church irrevocably committed itself to
			an unmarried priesthood. An immediate result was the institution of the
				<org>Agapetae</org>, a body of young women in platonic relations with the monks and
			secular priests. The Agapetae, it is hardly necessary to state, soon lost its platonic
			character and became one of the most scandalous institutions of the early middle ages.
			Nor was this the only scandal that followed in the tram of sacerdotal celibacy.</p>
		<p>The general situation in his lifetime is described by <person reg="Augustine of Hippo"
				>St. Augustine</person>, himself one of those by whose efforts sacerdotal celibacy
			was unposed. He found everywhere "<q who="AUG">ecclesiastics surrounded by young female
				slaves and leading an existence which differed from matrimony only in the absence of
				marriage ceremony.</q>" Like reports of conditions are given century after century.
			A stream of laws, punishments, and supervisory visits by church authorities prove at
			once, says Mr. Lea, "<q who="LEAHE">the hopelessness of the attempt and the incurable
				nature of the disorders of which the church was at once the cause and the
			victim</q>."</p>
		<p>In the ninth century after long continued and vigorous "cleanups," the <org
				reg="Council of Aix-en-Provence">Council at <place reg="Aix, France"
				>Aix</place></org> found that the convents were often brothels and that in the
			monasteries the denial of appropriate and healthful affection led to fearful and
			unnatural crimes.</p>
		<p>By the tenth century the decenter parish clergy, disgusted with the prevailing sacerdotal
			looseness, began to take wives, sometimes, if they could find like-minded priests to
			perform it, with the religious ceremony, sometimes as concubines, but even in these
			cases in a permanent and honorable union. Sometimes all the priests in a diocese were
			marned. In one case where a higher church dignitary protested they replied that "<q
				who="LEAHE">marriage was necessary to protect the church against the most hideous
				vices.</q>" In certain <place reg="Spain">Spanish provinces</place> indeed, for this
			very reason the parishioners compelled their parish priests to marry. Whether broken by
			immorality of marriage, the law was always, with whatever penalties it was enforced
			throughout the centuries, a dead letter with a large body of the clergy. The fight for
			sacerdotal celibacy was never fought to a successful conclusion.</p>
		<p>Today the priesthood is a smaller class relatively to the whole population, it can
			perhaps be recruited from that small group who have a vocation for asceticism. In the
			Middle Ages not ascetics alone, but all peace-loving men and women sought refuge in the
			religious life. Of such as these is the worldly man and woman of today and with such
			evidence as this of the impracticability of enforcing celibacy, or such self control in
			marriage as amounts to celibacy on the rank and file, we can only agree with <person
				reg="Athenagoras of Athens">Athenagoras,</person> one of the early fathers of the
			Church who opposed the inauguration of the practice, that "<q who="ATH">that law is not
				from <name type="deity">God</name> which enjoins upon us practices contrary to our
				nature.</q>"</p>
		<p>Mr. Lea's study has a moral not only for Roman Catholics, but for all those who believe
			that sex and population problems can be solved by the magic formula Self-control.</p>
