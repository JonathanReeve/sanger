			<p>"<q who="CT">Mrs. Sanger rang the changes on the deplorable conditions brought about
					by the reproduction of the insane, the feeble-minded, the tubercular, the very
					poor, and the dependant. She told touching stories of young couples struggling
					with adversity and babies during the first years of their married life. She
					described the hardships of poor mothers with large families. She said that it
					was cruel to deny the means of preventing conception to a woman, who does not
					want children; and she stated that abortion is very commonly practiced.</q>"</p>
			<p>"<q who="CT">As an alleged panacea for all this and much more, Mrs. Sanger prescribes
					a system of birth control, which would provide physicians and nurses to instruct
					females in the ways and means of preventing conception. She claims these as some
					of the advantages of her system:</q>"</p>
			<p>"<q who="CT">Newly-weds could enjoy marital life a year or so without fear of
					pregnancy. Women, who want children, can have them when they wish; and
					women, who do not like babies, need not have any. Parents can put more into the
					raising of a few children; and 'we want a race of thoroughbreds.'</q>"</p>
