		<head>Margaret Sanger Backs Cause Before City Club; urges New Laws to Emancipate
			Women</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="RTU">Red-haired, vivacious Mrs. Margaret Sanger, petite untiring commander
					of the birth control movement, told Rochester City Club today that</q> “birth
				control is a matter of public health and preventive medicine and not a problem which
				private enterprise can solve.”</p>

			<p>
				<q who="RTU">She spoke in Hotel Seneca ballroom. Mrs. Sanger launched the American
					drive for birth control in 1914.</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				<q who="RTU">The dynamic leader of what is now a world-wide movement aimed to
					emancipate women and strengthen many of the races of the earth, Mrs. Sanger
					urges</q> “immediate amendment of the <name
					reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">present federal laws</name> which
				tie the hands of the physician and obstruct an adequate and scientific national
				birth control program.”</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RTU">More than 1,000 organizations representing 20,000,000 people in this
					country have indorsed her efforts to change</q> “obsolete federal laws,” <q
					who="RTU">she says.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub">Lines Up Forces.</head>
			<p><q who="RTU"> Mrs. Sanger is now lining up her forces for a fifth attempt at putting
					over the Federal legislative program. Defeated four times, the program asks
					comparatively little of the government, according to Mrs. Sanger.</q></p>
			<p> “I think our defeats have come about from a too conservative policy on our own
				part,” <q who="RTU">she said this morning.</q> “We have not asked for enough, I
				think we should ask for more.”</p>
			<p><q who="RTU">
					<org>The National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org> will
					ask <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> that the <org
						reg="United States Postal Service">United States mails</org> and common
					carriers be opened to doctors, hospitals, medical colleges and licenced
					clinics.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="RTU">Enthusiastic over the co-operation of the some 250 birth control
					clinics in this country, Mrs. Sanger points with growing pride to the momentum
					the movement is gaining abroad, especially in the <place reg="Asia"
						>Orient</place>.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Attacks Fascism</head>
			<p><q who="RTU"> She brands Fascist forms of government as weakening their own
					populations and pushing the status of women back to the lowest ebb since the
					dawn of Christianity. Despite efforts of Fascist governments to promote
					wholesale propagation of their subjects the birth rate in both
						<place>Italy</place> and <place>Japan</place> is decreasing, Mrs. Sanger
					declared.</q></p>
			<p><q who="RTU"> In <place>India</place> and in <place>China</place> the birth control
					movement is gaining rapid headway, she said, pointing to India as one of the
					chief fields for work in the movement. Mrs. Sanger recently returned from India,
					where, in the course of nearly four months, she gave 104 lectures.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="RTU"><person reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K.">Mahatma Gandhi</person>, whom Mrs,.
					Sanger saw for three days at <place reg="Wardha, India">Wardha</place>, agrees
					entirely with the birth control movement in principle, she said, adding that
					Gandhi’s political power has waned considerably although his spiritual power is
					still vitally evident.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Problems to be Solved</head>
			<p><q who="RTU"> Gandhi believes, she said, that India should cease producing multitudes
					of children until the health of the nation, the stupendous food problem and the
					inroads of disease have been solved.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="RTU">Work in the Orient is facilitated by absence of laws, spiritual and
					governmental, opposed to the movement, Mrs. Sanger said.</q></p>
			<p><q who="RTU"> In company with Mrs. <person reg="Fry, Marion W.">Luther C.
						Fry</person>, birth control leader in Monroe County, Mrs. Sanger visited the
						<place reg="Rochester, NY">Rochester</place> center this morning. She is a
					guest at the home of Mrs. <person reg="Gannett, Mary T. L.">Mary T. L.
						Gannett</person>, 15 Sibley Place.</q></p>

		<div type="section">
			<head> Mrs. Sanger Makes Please for Birth Control Urging Amendment to Present U.S. Law </head>

			<p><q who="RDC"> Public health measures and birth control legislation march hand in
					hand, Mrs. Margaret Sanger, champion of women, told the City Club yesterday at
					luncheon in Hotel Seneca.</q></p>

			<p> “When public health measures are enacted to allow all classes to live in better
				health, to decrease mortality rates and to lengthen life,” <q who="RDC">she
					said,</q> “it becomes absolutely necessary to control the number of births by
				similar measures. Otherwise we shall have a heavily overpopulated country.”</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RDC">Dissemination of birth control information is a public problem, she
					declared, and federal legislation will be introduced at the impending session of
					Congress to provide a scientific and adequate national program for limitation of
					births. </q>
			</p>

			<p> “I urge the immediate amendment of the present federal laws which tie the hands of
				the physician and obstruct an adequate and scientific national birth control
				program,” <q who="RDC">she said.</q> “More than 1,000 organizations with millions of
				members have endorsed our efforts to change these obsolete federal laws and 100,000
				individuals have personally pledged support.” </p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Names Three Conditions</head>

			<p><q who="RDC"> The crisp-spoken little woman who was greeted by the police when she
					arrived in Rochester to speak before the City Club 20 years ago laid down a
					triple set of conditions which determine the number of children which any family
					can bear. Determining factors are: (1) number which a family can support; (2)
					number which a mother can bear and care for; (3) number within which a family
					can maintain its standard of living.</q>
			</p>

			<p><q who="RDC"> Birth control does not necessarily mean limitation, Mrs. Sanger said,
					although it is desirable for the population of the United States to remain
					stationary for 20 years until the various groups present in the country are
					assimilated.</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				<q who="RDC">Opposition and apathy spring from the so-called “leaders,” she said, in
					the campaign for control of population. The masses don’t need education to
					accept its philosophy, but rather ask scientific methods of practice, she said.
					Officials in government office are either opposed or fearful of expressing a
					public opinion on the subject, she declared.</q>
			</p>

		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Cites General Demand</head>

			<p>
				<q who="RDC">As evidence of the fact that the poorer classes demand birth control
					education uniformly despite religious teachings, she pointed to the proportions
					of women who appear at <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> centers.
					Protestant religions contribute 33 per cent, Catholic 32 per cent and Jewish 31
					per cent, she said.</q></p>


			<p>
				<q who="RDC">Theories of opposition which hold that birth control “destroys life”
					are fallacious, she said.</q></p>

			<p> “The mere prevention of the fusion of two life cells can no more be classes as
				destruction of life than remaining unmarried or living in continence,” <q who="RDC"
					>Mrs. Sanger flared.</q></p>

			<p>
				<q who="RDC">That birth control would reduce the white race while other races
					increase is a false argument against it, she said. Birth control has been
					introduced, is being taught and is being increasingly practiced in Japan, China
					and India, she declared.</q></p>

		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Cites Toll of Women</head>

			<p>
				<q who="RDC">Women are losing their lives by bearing more children than is
					physically feasible; children are dying needlessly because of lack of care; and
					families are reduced to poverty, Mrs. Sanger charged, because the world fails to
					take action in regard to birth control.</q></p>


			<p><q who="RDC"> Questioned in the City Club forum about the influence of birth control
					information among unmarried persons and its relation to immorality, she charged
					that birth control will produce neither morality nor immorality. Morality or its
					opposite comes from the human himself, she said, mere information will have no
					bearing upon it.</q></p>

			<p>
				<q who="RDC">Mrs. Sanger yesterday was named winner of the award of the honor
					offered annually by the <org>Town Hall Club</org> of New York City for the</q>
				<q who="THC"> “most conspicuous contribution to the enlargement and enrichment of
					life.”</q>
