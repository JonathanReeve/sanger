			<p>We are here today to discuss plans to effect the Amendment of a <name type="law"
					reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Federal law Sec 211</name>,
				passed by <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org>
				<add><person reg="Comstock, Anthony">Comstock</person></add> just 56 years ago.</p>
			<p>This law prohibits the sending thru the <org reg="United States Post Office">U.S.
					Mail</org> of books, pamphlets, articles, records, charts, medical, scientific
				or data of any kind relative to <add>the</add> prevention of conception.</p>
			<p> There is no exception to the law, no exception to scientific or educational or
				medical literature no exception to Physicians or <add>to</add> any group whose
				usefulness to society might be advanced by such information.</p>
			<p>It is said that the bill has rushed thru Congress on the last day of its session amid
				great confusion &amp; hurry--few congressmen knew the significance of the bill they
				had voted on.</p>
			<p>66,000 signatures were sent to Congress in protest of the bill immediately after but
				nothing came of it &amp; the citizens of this country have had to put up with
				bootleg information to limit the size of the family or resign themselves to the
				inheritable. <add>Here we began the first steps to effect the differential birth
					rate. </add> It is estimated that since the passage of this law over
					<add>1,</add>150,000 mothers have died in U.S.A. from causes due to pregnancy
				&amp; 15, million infants under one year of age have passed out of this life 90% of
				them due to poverty &amp; neglect.</p>
			<p>From 1876 to 1914 there was no concentrated effort on the part of any group to arouse
				public sentiment to change the law. It was a long period of arrests &amp; shameful
				persecutions on the part of the <org
					reg="New York State Society for the Suppression of Vice">Comstock
				Society</org>.</p>

			<p>When I came upon the horizon in 1914 I had seen such misery &amp; unhappiness among
				the overburdened mothers of the poor during my nursing work in <place
					reg="New York, NY">NYC</place> that I was convinced that our heavy toll of
				mothers lives--our maternal mortality could be lessened if sick &amp; ailing &amp;
				poverty burdened mothers, Tb &amp; heart &amp; kidneys could be protected from child
				bearing. </p>
			<p>I was convinced that our infant <supplied resp="MSPP">mortality</supplied>
				<emph rend="underline">could</emph> be greatly reduced if our mothers were protected
				to space out babies--<org reg="United States Children's Bureau">Children's
					Bureau</org> of <place reg="Washington, DC">Wash DC</place>
				<add>Where there is one</add> Interval of 3 years between births of babies There is
				a better chance of living than where only 1 year. It also shows us that
					<supplied>Deaths of</supplied> 2nd children less 100 per m <lb/> 7 <lb/> over
				350 " " " " 12 " " 600 per m. 60% of 12 <supplied>children</supplied> die</p>
			<p>I felt that the legislation &amp; palliative efforts to lessen infant mortality were
				not enough. Child labor laws were not enough. If we are to make the world safe for
				childhood safe for future generations, safe for civilization then we must stop at
				its source the unending stream of death doomed infants thru birth control.</p>
