		<head>Mrs. Sanger Explains Where Most Chicago Babies Come From</head>

		<p>
			<q who="TDB">What makes <place reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</place> grow? Where do
				thebabies come from? From what districts do the increase of business customers, the
				increase of population, that cause rising land values, come from?</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="TDB">Margaret Sanger, birth control advocate answers. She says working class
				women, pro rata, woman for woman, breed and bring to the daylight of Chicago three
				times as many babies as the women of the rich and well-to-do class.</q>
		</p>

		<p>"I am getting the figures on Chicago," <q who="DB">said Mrs. Sanger to a <title
					type="journal">Day Book</title> reporter at <org>Congress Hotel</org> today.</q>
			"And I am sure that the showing in Chicago will be much the same as that of <place
				reg="Paris, France">Paris</place> and of <place reg="Berlin, Germany"
			>Berlin</place>.</p>
		<p>"The women on the fashionable Lake Shore drive have the money to pay physicians to tell
			the growing daughters, young married women, how to take care of themselves. They know
			how to stop babies from coming when babies are not wanted. Skilled physicians give these
			women this knowledge on how to stop the babies from coming."</p>
		<p>"In the stockyards district, or any other swarming working class district, babies and
			babies come and these babies are not welcome. They arrive because the mothers don't have
			the same knowledge as the women on the Lake Shore drive."</p>
		<p>"A survey in Paris showed 32 births per 1,000 among women in a residential district of
			rich. In a poor working class district, a typical one, the birth rate was 116 per
			1,000."</p>
		<p>"In Berlin the rate was 47 per 1,000 among the well-to-do women and 157 per 1,000 among
			the poor."</p>

		<p>
			<q who="TDB">Mrs. Sanger lectures Sunday night in <org reg="Little Theater of Chicago"
					>Little theater</org>, <org reg="Fine Arts Building">Fine Arts bldg</org>. Her
				secretary, <person reg="Mindell, Fania">Fania Mindell</person>, said today that all
				seats have been sold, with more calls coming, and the lecture may be given in
				Assembly hall, Fine Arts bldg. Several hundred were turned away Tuesday night in
					<org reg="Worker's Institute">Workers' Institute</org>.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="TDB">The big main proposition she stands for is that working class women should
				have the same information about birth control, regulation of the number of children
				to a family, that rich women have.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="TDB">The Sanger woman was a trained nurse 14 years in obstetric cases and
				personally served mothers in several thousand births. She is herself the mother of
				two superb children, and has won her way against terrific opposition by force of an
				unusual personality.</q>
		</p>

		<p>"Of course, it is not pleasant for some girls to face the facts of birth control," <q
				who="TDB">she said. </q>"But I would urge upon any wife of an underpaid
				<supplied>man chance?</supplied> that it is far more unpleasant for her to find
			herself burdened down with half a dozen children she never wished for, helpless,
			starved, shoddily clothed children dragging at her skirts and she only a dragged-out
			shadow of the woman she once was."</p>
		<p>"Women of the working class, especially wage workers, should not have more than two
			children at the most. The average workingman can support no more and the average working
			woman can take care of no more in decent fashion."</p>
		<p>"It has been my experience that more children are not really wanted, but that the women
			are compelled to have them either from lack of foresight or through ignorance of the
			hygiene of preventing conception."</p>
		<p>"It is only the workers who are ignorant of the knowledge of how to prevent bringing
			children into the world to fill the hospitals and jails, factories and mills, insane
			asylums and premature graves."</p>
		<p>"The working class can use direct action by refusing to supply the labor market with
			children to be exploited, by refusing to populate the earth with slaves."</p>
