		<head>Birth Control.</head>

		<p>The activities of the <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>, Inc. (formerly
			the Birth Control Federation of America), through its 347 state leagues and committees
			and 599 clinics, were given material support and stimulation by events of 1945, which
			found child spacing services either through clinics or referral systems. available in
			every state except <place>Connecticut</place> and <place>Massachusetts</place>. These
			were in 1945 the only states retaining legal barriers which prevented physicians
			prescribing birth control under any condition.</p>
		<p> Legal Decisions.- Two pertinent decisions were handed down in 1945 by the district court
			of appeals in <place>Washington, D.C.</place> The first, a permanent injunction barring
			the postmaster general from interfering with the mailing of the <org>Consumer’s
				Union</org>
			<title type="pamphlet">“Report on Contraceptive Material</title>”; the second,
			overruling the postmaster general’s mailing ban on <person reg="Popenoe, Paul">Paul
				Popenoe</person>'s pamphlet, <title type="pamphlet">“Preparing for
				Marriage.”</title></p>
		<p> In Connecticut a bill to permit physicians to prescribe birth control for patients in
			poor health was killed in committee, although a <org
				reg="Roper Center for Public Opinion Research">Roper</org> survey made just previous
			to the bill’s introduction revealed that 85% of the state’s adult voters were in favor
			of changing existing laws.</p>
		<p> Medical and Public Health.- <person reg="Herrick, William W.">Dr. William W.
				Herrick</person>, president of the <org>New York Academy of Medicine</org>, <place
				reg="New York, New York">New York city</place>, headed a committee of 40 of the
			city’s distinguished physicians who presented a program on “Responsibility for the
			Health of Tomorrow’s Family” at the federation’s 24th annual dinner. Dinner speakers
			included <person reg="Williams, R.C.">Dr. R. C. Williams</person>, assistant U.S.
			surgeon-general, U.S. public health service; <person reg="Schumann, Edward A.">Dr.
				Edward A. Schumann</person>; and <person reg="Grinker, Roy R.">Lt. Col. Roy R.
				Grinker</person>, medical executive, Army Air Force Convalescent hospital, <place
				reg="St. Petersburg, FL">St. Petersburg, Fla</place>. A luncheon address by <person
				reg="Roosevelt, Eleanor">Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt</person>, before a symposium of
			social agencies interested in postwar family health, including planned parenthood, was
			broadcast over a national network.</p>
		<p> Temperature chars to assist in determining optimum fertility were made available to
			physicians by the federation’s medical committee, to aid in the treatment of
			infertility. This phase of the planned parenthood program was increased with
			establishment of added infertility services or referral systems in various parts of the
			country. </p>
		<p>From a study of 7,000,000 births, <person reg="Yerushalmey, Jacob">Dr. Jacob
				Yerushalmey</person>, principal statistician of the U.S. public health service,
			published a report advocating an optimum interval between births to decrease the number
			of stillbirths.</p>
		<p> Research. - To stimulate research in the field of human fertility, the <org
				reg="The Lasker Foundation">Albert and Mary Lasker foundation</org> made the first
			of its two annual awards of $500 each to the scientist and public health official making
			significant contributions during the year. Awards for 1945 went to <person
				reg="MacLeod, John James Rickard">Dr. John MacLeod</person>, department of anatomy,
				<org>Cornell University</org> Medical college, <place reg="Ithaca, NY">Ithaca,
				N.Y.</place>, for research in the motility of the <org>Mississippi state board of
				health</org> for including planned parenthood in his state’s public health program
			to improve infant and maternal health. </p>
		<p>Education. - The publication of two new patient pamphlets, <title type="pamphlet"
				>“Planning to Have a Baby?”</title> and <title type="pamphlet">“The Soldier Takes a
				Wife”</title> contributed materially to the large amount of literature requested
			during the year. <title type="pamphlet">“To Those Denied a Child”</title> and <title
				type="pamphlet">“Population and Peace,”</title> a reprint of an address by <person
				reg="Fairchild, Henry Pratt">Dr. Henry Pratt Fairchild</person> at the
				<org>University of Virginia</org>, were also in great demand. Quantities of
			technical manuals and other planned parenthood literature were sent on request to
			physicians, educators, health officer, clergymen and social workers.</p>
		<p> Social Work. - <org reg="National Association of Social Workers">National Social Work
				Advisory </org>committee was organized to give professional advice on the social
			work program. The <org reg="Young Women's Christian Association">Y.W.C.A.</org>
			announced its resolution favouring “the principles of planned parenthood.” Planned
			parenthood literature was included by the <org>National Publicity council</org> in its
			mailings to social agencies throughout the country, many of which ordered further
			literature for distribution. </p>
		<p>Work With Negroes. - A second consultant on work with Negroes was added to the national
			staff, and several state organizations employed Negro field workers and included Negro
			members in their executive committees. A model clinic, the <org>Hannah Stone Planned
				Parenthood centre</org>, was established in <place reg="New York, NY">Harlem
			</place>district, New York city, to aid in reducing stillbirth, infant and maternal
			mortality, which is twice that of other parts of the city. Following an intensive study,
			the <org>National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers</org> drew up a discussion
			outline of planned parenthood to be distributed to Negro community groups.</p>
		<p> Religion.- A syllabus on marriage and family counseling was published by the
			federation’s <org> National Clergyman’s Advisory council </org>and made available for us
			in seminaries, community training schools and to individual clergymen. Army and navy
			chaplains made wide use of the G.I. pamphlet, <title type="pamphlet">“The Soldier Takes
				a Wife,”</title> and the library of congress translated the pamphlet into braille
			for blinded veterans. The <place>Illinois</place> league for planned parenthood added
			500 ministers and rabbis to its Clergyman’s Advisory committee and a number of other
			state organizations established similar complanned parenmittees.</p>
		<p> Press and Radio. - Eighty articles reflecting favourable planned parenthood attitudes
			appeared in national popular and technical magazines during 1945. The announcement of
			the federation’s two new pamphlets, (see Education, above) attracted considerable
			newspaper comment, and wire services carried the story throughout the country. Cordial
			relations with many local radio stations were strengthened and both <org>National
				Broadcasting Company</org> and org system carried important annual meeting speakers.
			The <org>Mutual Broadcasting system</org> requested a speaker to discuss <title
				type="pamphlet">“The Soldier Takes a Wife”</title> during a national news cast. The
					<org><place reg="Houston, TX">Houston (Texas)</place> Maternal health
				centre</org> produced a 15 minute transcription which is available to all planned
			parenthood groups for local broadcast. </p>
		<p>International. -Interest in planned parenthood showed new gains throughout the world with
			the ending of World War II. In <place>England</place>, governmental inquiries disclosed
			that economic and national insecurity, not the knowledge of birth control, was the
			determining factor in the declining birth rate. <place>China</place> and
				<place>Japan</place> took official steps to adopt birth control measures to help
			solve their problems of overpopulation. Students of demography reported that
				<place>India</place> must include birth control in its health program if the high
			infant and maternal mortality was to be reduced. The western world learned of a ruling
			of the <person reg="al-Husseini, Haj Amin">grand mufti of <place>Egypt
			</place></person>in 1937 grating legal and religious permission for the practice of
			birth control. (See also <title type="article">BIRTH STATISTICS</title>.) (M. Sr.)</p>
