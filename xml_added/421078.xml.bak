		<head type="sub"> U.S.A. Has the Greatest Percentage of Deaths in Childbirth</head>
		<p> “For five minutes my proposal concerning a change in <place reg="United States"
				>U.S.A.</place>’s sixty-year old <name reg="United States Penal Code">Birth Control
				Law</name> was actually elevated to law,” <q who="DAGEN">related Mrs. <person
					reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, known over the whole world as
				the foremost pioneer for Birth Control, and now on a visit to <place
					reg="Stockholm, Sweden">Stockholm</place>.</q> “But afterwards an elderly
			gentleman in the <org reg="United States Senate">Senate</org> woke up and protested, and
			so the work of many years for a change in this vital problem was stopped for the time
			being. But next year it will go through.”</p>
		<q who="DAGEN">
			<p> Mrs. Sanger, who is traveling in <place>Europe</place> with the intention of
				starting an international movement for organized Birth Control, and has no arrived
				in Stockholm, is a lady with a gallant and tumultuous past. And that she did little
				on her own part to avoid the storms one can see immediately in her red Irish hair
				and clear blue American eyes. She has been called America’s most slandered woman,
				and that is quite correct. To begin a campaign for legalized birth control
				twenty-five years ago in American must have been a task with many risks. Between
				1921, when she called together the first <org
					reg="First American Birth Control Conference">Birth Control Conference</org> in
				America, and now, when her proposition became law, if only for five minutes, lie
				many defeats and many personal persecutions, but also many glorious victories. Her
				first step on the way to which her experience as a child in a large and poor family
				drove her was an article in her own paper, “<title type="journal">The Woman
					Rebel</title>,” which was followed immediately by a commitment. She eluded the
				action by escaping to <place>England</place>, and when, a year later she returned to
				the United States, such a strong European opinion stood back of her that the
				authorities found it advisable to forget the little incident of by-gone days.
				Nevertheless, since then she has served a month’s imprisonment. </p>

			<head type="sub"> Birth Control the Only Way to Peace</head>
			<p> “To me it was quite clear,” <q who="DAGEN">she declares,</q> “that now since all the
				countries have closed their boundaries to other nations the only solution to the
				problem of peace is control of population. If you do not choose this method, there
				is only one other, a lowering of the standard of living. And the end is that women
				become the slaves of militarism, that the countries need colonies, the colonies new
				soldiers for their defense, and so on, in one vicious circle.</p>
			<p> “In America, as I said, the law on this question is 60 years old and has never been
				changed. As a consequence of this we have the highest percentage of deaths in
				childbirth in the whole world. Thanks to the somewhat varying laws of the different
				states we have finally come so far that we have nearly 140 more or less officially
				tolerated clinics for birth control information, of which one is mine, and in my
				work I have had occasion to help 50,000 women. But much still needs to be done, and
				that is why I am making this trip. I shall go to <place reg="Soviet Union"
					>Russia</place> to study their organizations for women and how they solve the
				problem home - work. But before this I shall meet with some of my friends here in
				order to talk with them and form a group to continue work. From <place>India</place>
				an inquiry has also come asking I will come there and take part in a congress which
				represents 11 million women. And, as I said, the next time my proposed law
				concerning permission from doctors and other medical scientists to render positive
				enlightenment regarding Birth Control comes up, I believe it will be difficult to
				count the minutes of its duration.”</p>
			<q who="DAGEN">
				<p> Wednesday, at one o’clock at Moseback there will be a meeting between Mrs.
					Sanger and Swedish doctors and others who are interested.</p>
