		<head>20TH CENTURY CLUB HEARS MRS SANGER</head>
		<div>
			<p><q who="BDG"><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs. Margaret Sanger</person> of <place
						reg="New York, NY">New York,</place> before the <org>Twentieth Century
						Club</org> yesterday discussed "War and Overpopulation." and <person
						reg="Overstreet, Harry Allen">Prof H.A. Overstreet</person> of New York
					answered the question he earlier asked: "What Shall we do with the Older
					Generation?"</q></p>
			<p><q who="BDG">Mrs. Sanger said:</q> "There are two phases of the population question
				which concern the serious, scientific thought of the world-and one is the pressure
				of population on the food supply, which I will not attempt to take up here."</p>
			<p><q who="BDG">She then referred to the book by <person reg="East, Edward M.">Prof
						East,</person>
					<title type="book">"Mankind at the Crossroads."</title></q></p>
			<p>"The other side of the problem concerns the reconciling humanitarianism with the
				races of men," <q who="BDG">she said.</q> "There are two ways of controlling
				population-by increasing the death rate or decreasing the birth rate. We have
				increased the types of men in <place reg="United States">America</place> and we no
				longer think of disease and the inroads of the feeble-minded as necessary to
				increase and multiply."</p>

		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Cites Progress</head>
			<p>"What does it mean in our time that in 1923 we spent $8,000,000,000 on the diseased
				and defectives, this being a function of public charity? Is that expenditure, to
				wipe out disease? It means that 10 years from now we will double the amount to be
				expended in the same cause.</p>
			<p>"If we are as we consider ourselves really a very generous, big-hearted people, if we
				apply the same efficiency to clear up our conditions here, as we do in other
				matters, we should wipe out this condition in one generation. We establish milk
				stations, but we allow thousands of parents to remain in utter ignorance of the
				conditions of proper living.</p>
			<p>"People with 10 children don't want to be told how to raise additional children. The
				mothers of these much prefer to be told how to keep them alive without the coming of
				the extra 11th child."</p>
			<p><q who="BDG">The speaker opposed child labor outside the family.
						<place>England</place>, <place>Japan</place>, <place>Italy</place> and
						<place>Australia</place>, she says, have great child labor and population
					problems.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Marriage Problems</head>
			<p><q who="BDG">Mrs. Sanger then said that marriage should be preceded in all lands by
					education as to motherhood and that control of child-bearing be given until the
					economic ways of preservation were fully studied and understood.</q> "We want,"
					<q who="BDG">said the speaker,</q>"to have young married couples accorded a year
				or two after marriage just to play together and develop the cultural side of their
				relations."</p>
			<p>"It is not an easy thing for men and women to live together now as they did 40 or 50
				years ago. We are trying to leave these young people to enjoy themselves; we are
				trying to recreate and build up new homes and we want to make women free."</p>
