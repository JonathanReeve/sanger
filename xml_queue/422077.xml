		<head> Mrs. Sanger Lectures Here</head>
		<q who="RT">
			<p>Mrs. Margaret Sanger lectured at <org>Odd Fellows Hall</org> last evening. It was for
				women only. The subject announced at the box office was "Birth Control." It was an
				account of the lecturer's written and spoken efforts upon this much discussed
				question that she gained a great deal of both notoriety and publicity.</p>
			<p>Last December Mrs. Sanger lectured <place reg="Reading, PA">here</place> before a
				large mixed audience and her remarks at the time met with such approval and interest
				that her return last night was requested by the new women's organization -- the
					<org>Berks County Association of Women Workers</org>.</p>
			<p>The strong point in her birth control advocacy is based upon the physical condition
				of the mother. Mrs. Sanger is opposed to the childless marriage, being the mother of
				four children herself. Before marriage she was a trained nurse.</p>
