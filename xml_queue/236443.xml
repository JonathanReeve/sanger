		<p><place>England</place>--the home of the B.C. movement has during the past ten years shown
			tremendous advance.</p>
		<p>From the time of the <person reg="Besant, Annie">Besant</person> &amp; <person
				reg="Bradlaugh, Charles">Bradlaugh</person> in 1878 the theories of <person
				reg="Malthus, Thomas Robert">Malthus</person> were advocated by a small intelligent
			fearless group of idealists who labored through the years to educate--not the
			masses--but the educators. This process has certainly been successful as is seen by the
			differential birth rate of not only England but of <del>nearly all English speaking
					<place>France</place></del>
			<place>Western Europe</place> as well.</p>
		<p>The work now is to <del>spread</del>
			<add>direct</add> the information to that class of the population called 3-C class for
			health as well as Economic <del>needs</del> reasons.</p>
		<p>While there are 22 clinics operating in England under private auspices, this is not
			sufficient to cover the huge population &amp; especially to reach these mothers whose
			physical condition or that of their children show the necessity of controlling the size
			of the family. There are in England hundreds of centers known as Maternity &amp; Infant
			Welfare which are partly or wholly supported by grants from the government. The Movement
			is now directed toward getting governmental approval of alluring the Doctors in charge
			of these centers to advise &amp; instruct the mothers who ask for such instruction. This
			is the only way the quality of the population can be raised by directing the knowledge
			of B.C. to those whose physical &amp; Economic conditions <del>demand it</del> would be
			benefited by it.</p>
		<p>The <org reg="United Kingdom House of Lords">House of Lords</org>
			<del>voted</del>
			<add>through</add> Lord <person reg="Buckmaster, Stanley">Buckmaster</person> passed a
			resolution, in favor of this act. This lead a most profound influx on British public
			opinion . The <org reg="United Kingdom House of Commons">Commons</org> turned it down,
			but it will be brought up again at an early date. </p>
		<p>The birth rate of England is the lowest in <place>Europe</place>, its death rate is also
			correspondingly low. 16 . . <place>France</place> 18.</p>
		<p>With <place>Australia</place> &amp; <place>Canada</place> refusing her slum populations,
			but desiring her better quality citizens--England has set her face to improve her
			quality--I believe she will be the first government in the world to sanction openly
			&amp; fearlessly the practice of birth control. Instead of looking to the future--she
			mourns on the past. France--who sees that within the last 50 years.
				<place>Germany</place> has increased her population 28 million. <place>Italy</place>
			16 millions while she has 2 millions.--70,000 Poles 1926 to France.</p>
