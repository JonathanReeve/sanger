		<head>Japs Hit Birth Control As War Block</head>
		<byline>by <person reg="Cohen, Lucille">Lucille Cohen</person></byline>

		<p>
			<q who="COHLU">Japanese militarists as far back as 1921 were fighting dissemination of
				birth control information, fearful that a lowered birth rate would block their plans
				for war, Mrs. Margaret Sanger, national leader of the birth control movement,
				declared yesterday in Seattle.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="COHLU">And unless the men who dictate the peace terms force
				<place>Japan</place>, <place>Germany</place> and <place>Italy</place> to control
				their birth rates instead of their armament production, the three countries will
				throw the world into war again in 20 years, she added.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="COHLU">Mrs. Sanger bases her opinions on her own experiences in Japan in 1921
				when she was invited to make a speaking tour with <person reg="Russell, Bertrand"
					>Bertrand Russell</person>, the English philosopher, and <person
					reg="Einstein, Albert">Albert Einstein</person>, the German mathematical
				genius.</q>
		</p>

		<p>
			<q who="COHLU">First the Japanese government canceled Mrs. Sanger’s visa and then when
				she managed to get into the country--</q>“by intrigue,”<q who="COHLU"> she says--
				she found she was allowed to make only private speeches. </q></p>
		<p> “The people were clamoring for the information I was bringing,” <q who="COHLU"> she
				said.</q> “Japanese women are like women everyplace else. They didn’t want to be
			burdened down with a baby every year until they had more children than they could raise
			or educate.</p>
		<p>“But the military group wasn’t going to let them hear me. The militarists were beating
			the tom-toms for the glory of prolific motherhood and what it would do for Japan and her
			place in the sun.”</p>
		<p>
			<q who="COHLU">When Mrs. Sanger returned to Japan in 1939 for the second and last time
				she discovered plans for increasing the birth rate were getting along fine--with the
				help of American money. </q>
		</p>
		<p> “The first time I was there the birth rate was about two million a year, of which about
			one million babies lived” <q who="COHLU"> she said. </q>"The second time I found that
			with private American funds given for improving public health the Japanese were cutting
			down the infant mortality rate so that between 1,500,000 and 1,800,000 of the babies
			born each year lived.”</p>

		<p>
			<q who="COHLU"> As outlined to her by Japanese parliament members, the militarists’ plan
				was to encourage population growth to create a need for expansion that would, in
				turn, provide an excuse for war.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="COHLU"> Mrs. Sanger is here visiting her son, Lt. Grant Sanger of <place
					reg="Seattle, WA">4702 W. Ruffner St.</place>, a member of the naval medical
				corps stationed in Seattle. Her other son, Ctp. Stuart Sanger, is in
					<place>England</place> with the army.</q>
