			<q who="NYT">
				<p> Asserting that rapidly increasing populations of <place>Germany</place>,
						<place>Italy</place> and <place>Japan</place> are a menace to peace because
					of the “inevitable need” for territorial expansion, Mrs. <person
						reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> pleaded tonight before a
						<org>Washington Town Hall</org> audience that birth control was necessary if
					world peace was to be assured. </p>
			</q>
			<q who="NYT">
				<p> The international leader of the birth-control movement scored the motives of
					Chancellor <person reg="Hitler, Adolf">Hitler</person> and Premier <person
						reg="Mussolini, Benito">Mussolini</person> in urging population increases in
					their countries. She declared that war was inevitable unless the rapid gain in
					births was halted. </p>
			</q>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said health officials estimated that 3.1 acres were needed
					to produce food and clothing necessary for one person to live ideally; 1.8 acres
					necessary for health, and 1.2 acres were absolutely necessary for existence. She
					pointed out that, within a few years, the tillable land in the three countries
					would not be sufficient to sustain life properly, and then, she added,</q> “the
				explosion will come.” <q who="NYT">Japan’s “seizure” of <place>Manchukuo</place> and
					Italy’s conquest of <place>Ethiopia</place>, she said, were necessary for them
					to acquire the land to sustain the populations and offer some outlet for their
					surplus populations.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">In so far as the <place>United States</place> was concerned, Mrs.
					Sanger said, of the 4,500,000 births recorded during the present depression, 65
					per cent came in families on relief. She declared that</q> “relief is not a
				temporary situation,” <q who="NYT">and that the problem could be best solved through
					birth control.</q></p>
			<p> “We have increased that strata of our population that we do not need,” <q who="NYT"
					>she said.</q></p>

			<head> Overcrowding Peril Discussed by Mrs. Sanger</head>
			<q who="WP">
				<p> Birth control, crop control, the machine age and the slaughter of the AAA’s
					little pigs were debated last night at the Town Hall of Washington after Mrs.
					Margaret Sanger spoke on “Overpopulation- A Cause of War.”</p>
			</q>
			<q who="WP">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger called for a 25-year moratorium on population increase in the world
					as a method of assuring peace, but members of the discussion panel contended
					that redistribution of natural resources and more efficient methods of
					distributing the products of industry was the solution. </p>
			</q>
			<q who="WP">
				<p> Contending that warlike tendencies in Germany, Italy and Japan were the result
					of overpopulation, Mrs. Sanger advocated making birth control an important
					function of every State and municipal health department. She warned that the
					world is approaching the day when it cannot support its population. </p>
			</q>
			<p>
				<q who="WP"><person reg="Lubin, Isador">Isador Lubin</person>, commissioner of
						<org>Labor Statistics, Department of Labor</org>, declared the world has not
					yet begun to intelligently approach the problem of supporting its
					population.</q>
				<q who="LUBIS">“We have a fetish that everyone should work all of the time,”</q>
				<q who="WP">he said.</q>
				<q who="LUBIS">“We must utilize the full capacity of industrial machines and to
					distribute work and income that persons could retire early and live well.”</q>
			</p>
			<q who="WP">
				<p> Both Lubin and Mrs. Sanger agreed that while crops were being plowed under and
					pigs slaughtered in this country because of “overproduction,” the farmers were
					not producing enough to support the population.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="WP">
				<p> The Rev. <person reg="Clinchy, Russell J.">Russell J. Clinchy</person>, pastor
					of the <org>Mount Pleasant Congregational Church</org>, said the intelligent
					approach to birth control called for discarding the theory that relations
					between married couples not intended to produce children were carnal. </p>
			</q>
			<q who="WP">
				<p> The audience cut short a speech by <person reg="Howe, Frederick C.">Frederick C.
						Howe</person>, special assistant to the <org
						reg="United States Secretary of Agriculture">Secretary of Agriculture</org>,
					while he was contending that lust for power was responsible for wars and
					advocating restricting the freedom of the press. The audience demanded Howe put
					his remarks in a question to Mrs. Sanger. </p>
