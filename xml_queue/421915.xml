				<q who="LADN">From <place reg="Honolulu, HI">Honolulu</place> Miss <person
						reg="Sanger, Margaret">Sanger</person> sent these comments:</q> “Population
				pressure is a cause of war, and <place>Japan</place>, <place>Italy</place> and
					<place>Germany</place>, through failure to control their birthrates, are
				justifying predictions that they would become the world’s ‘danger spots’.” </p>

			<p> “Japan had 64,000,000 persons when I was there in 1922, and since then the
				population has increased steadily from 800,000 to 1,000,000 a year,” <q who="LADN"
					>she said</q>. “But despite the annexation of <place>Manchukuo</place>, Japan is
				still land-hungry. It has become, with Germany and Italy, a destroyer of
				civilization through ruthless waging of arrogant warfare against innocent, peaceful
				peoples.</p>
			<p> “All these nations refuse to control their birthrate, and they refuse to give to
				women the simple knowledge that could save the lives of untold thousands of women. </p>
			<p> “Women’s progress in Japan has been retarded- the women have not been able to
				maintain the advances they had made as far back as 1922. Reactionary forces, soon
				after the earthquake, set up a strong, bureaucratic, militaristic government, and
				since then women have not been allowed the natural freedom of evolutionary progress.
				Women are not granted degrees in their colleges and universities, and of all the
				women who have been allowed to attend medical universities, only 16 have been
				granted medical degrees, through ‘special dispensation.’”</p>

			<p> “In Japan,” <q who="LADN">she said</q>, “a campaign of public health is just raising
				its head, and a new health institute which will provide an opportunity for mothers
				in outlying districts to receive medical aid, but not birth control aid, will open
				next year. But one can never foresee what may happen in a militaristic country, and
				so the future is still dark and overclouded.” </p>

			<p> “As far back as 1925,” <q who="NYT">she wrote</q>, “Professor <person
					reg="Thompson, Warren">Warren Thompson</person>, in his brilliant analysis of
				the population problem, named Italy, Japan and Germany as ‘danger spots’ of the
				world. Japan is fulfilling that prophecy, and not only are these countries the
				danger spots of the world, but they are the destroyers of our civilization through
				their ruthless method of waging arrogant warfare against innocent, peaceful peoples. </p>
			<p> “All of these three nations refuse to control their birth rates and they also refuse
				to give to their women and to their mothers the simple knowledge which could save
				the lives of thousands upon thousands of these women and avoid the destitution,
				misery and enslavement of large masses of their population.”</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said Japan</q> “is keenly disappointed over the natural
				resources of Manchukuo and is still land-hungry.”</p>
