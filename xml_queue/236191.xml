		<head>A New Day is Dawning</head>
		<byline>by <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person></byline>
		<p>How many people know that nearly sixty years ago <org reg="United States Congress"
				>Congress</org> passed a law which made it a Penitentiary offense for anyone (even a
			doctor) to send through the <place>United States</place> mails the address of another
			physician, or a clinic, <emph rend="underlined">where</emph> one could obtain
			information to prevent conception?</p>
		<p> At that time, it is true, very little was known about the controversial subject now
			known as Birth Control. The instigator of that law, <person reg="Comstock, Anthony"
				>Anthony Comstock</person>, was a religious bigot, ignorant as he was fanatical. He
			seemed imbued with the complex that everything relating to sex was obscene. He allowed
			no exceptions to scientific or medical needs or facts. All was classed in his mind as
			obscene. Though over two generations have passed since the time that law was enacted,
			women have gained suffrage; colleges and universities teach scientific biological facts
			of life to students; social hygiene is part of our educational programme; yet nothing
			has been done by women’s clubs, colleges or the medical profession to dignify their
			stand by cleaning up these archaic laws.</p>
		<p> Some of us in the Birth Control Movement have attempted to amend these Federal laws and
			are now working in <place rend="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</place></p>
		<p> The first obstacle in the removal of any bad law is to attack the ignorance surrounding
			it. While Congressmen’s families are notoriously small, as are doctors and ministers,
			and the professional and artisan classes, they seem unable to concede that Birth Control
			knowledge should be given to others, especially to the poor people who need and want it
			most.</p>
		<p> The essential facts of Birth Control are, first, that it is prevention of conception,
			not interruption of pregnancy after conception has taken place. Secondly, that it is
				<emph rend="underlined">control</emph>, not necessarily limitation; to control the
			birth rate is to control the size of the family; it means the spacing of births in the
			family with some regard to the mother’s health; to the inheritance both husband and wife
			are able or likely to pass on to children; to the health of the children already born;
			to the father’s earning power; to the standards of living the parents wish to
			maintain.</p>
		<p> These considerations should be regarded in planning marriage, for it is a well-known
			fact that couples who can space the arrival of babies, from three to four years, are
			better able to care for a good sized family of four children on the average wage of a
			skilled worker.</p>
		<p> No wage earner can possibly care for <emph rend="underlined">all</emph> the children
			nature can bestow upon a healthy normal couple. On an average there are thirty years of
			possible fertility in a woman’s life during which time she could produce twenty to
			twenty-five children. Not all of them would live, of course, but funerals and doctors
			bills are heavy burdens on a working man’s already meagre income.</p>
		<p> The history of labor has been an age-long battle to bring man’s earning power up to his
			needs for a growing and increasing family. It’s been a losing battle all the way, for by
			increasing his numbers he has brought about hunger and want, ignorance and strife. He
			goes on strike to increase his wage, while a mob of hungry workers stand ready and
			willing to take his place at the factory gates. It is the man with a large family who is
			tied down by fear of losing his job. He is the last to fight for higher wages when a
			strike comes, and the first to crawl back at any price. The plain truth of the labor
			problem is that the workers have produced too many children– too many for their own
			good; too many for the health of the mother, too many for the health, development and
			happiness of their own children and too many for our civilization in its present state
			of evolution.</p>
		<p> By rapid multiplication of themselves they have deepened their evil conditions,
			intensified their miseries and made impotent their power as a class.</p>
		<p> Men at forty-five are thrown out of work for younger ones. Their children are forced
			into factories at an early age, which could be avoided if the size of the family was
			controlled to meet the conditions of the father’s earning power.</p>
		<p> It’s the working man who has the burden of the unproductive members of his family on his
			back. He blames the capitalist for his ills, but before there was a capitalist there was
			his own uncontrolled power to reproduce his numbers.</p>
		<p> It has been labor’s crime against civilization that his increasing numbers has goaded
			mankind into exploitation, into frenzied industry, into child labor and into wars. To
			this cause we can trace immigration as well as most of colonization leading into warfare
			of conquest. Labor-saving machinery has thrown thousands of able bodied men out of work.
			This probably condition was known to labor unions and economists as far back as the
			beginning of this century. All predictions were on the side of more machinery increasing
			production while decreasing the need for men or man power; yet they did nothing to meet
			this condition.</p>
		<p> They organized themselves into trade unions on the principle of limitation of numbers in
			a given trade, while the principle of limitation of numbers in the family was ignored. </p>
		<p>Today there is a scramble for jobs. Too many men– too few jobs. Machinery has taken man’s
			place and will continue to do his work as long as man seeks comfort and leisure, wealth,
			education and happiness.</p>
		<p> There are so many and so various aspects to this question of Birth Control, such as the
			aspect of health, economy, race, international war and peace, that it has created a
			literature within the past fifteen years which has by no means yet been exhausted.</p>
		<p> Ignorance of Birth Control has become an acknowledged factor in infant and maternal
			mortality, unemployment, child labor, the creation of slums, overcrowding, illiteracy,
			feeblemindedness and the general lowering intelligence of our population which is now on
			the increase.</p>
		<p> It is also a recognized factor in the increasing needs of charities and philanthropies.
			Huge fortunes are spent each year to meet the increasing costs of disease, dependency
			and crime.</p>
		<p> We find more individual care given by society to the defective and delinquent population
			than to the normal children of normal parents. Few, if any, moron children go hungry,
			while thousands of normal children are undernourished and suffering from malnutrition.
			If some of the money now spent on keeping alive the insane, the feebleminded and
			defective was divided and directed into constructive planning for race betterment we
			could soon see our way out. I’d like to see the <org reg="United States Government">U.S.
				Government</org> pension, an offer life pensions, to every man and woman with a
			known transmissible disease who would consent to sterilization. By such a method we
			would within one generation decrease the defectives and decrease the vast sums now
			derived from taxation for their maintenance. Thus would the normal family have better
			opportunities for education and development and gradually increase their own numbers and
			strength.</p>
		<p> To me this need of checking the defective increase of our population is so imperative
			that immediate action is necessary and sterilization is the answer. This is one of the
			methods of birth control, but a permanent method advised only where voluntary and
			temporary methods of contraception will not be applied.</p>
		<p> If the Government could control its vast population of morons, imbeciles, paupers,
			prostitutes, criminals, feebleminded and insane, and be made to answer to the people for
			their increase, we would soon become a leading nation in civilization. Already these
			undesirable types have been banned and excluded from entrance into the country by the
			Immigration Laws of 1924, but no check has been placed on those already here from
			increasing and multiplying their numbers at will.</p>
		<p> The cost to the present government of maintaining the above mentioned population runs
			into millions, even billions, and that is not all, for as these types multiply fact,
			being nearly three times more prolific than our normal women, we are piling up huge
			debts for unborn generations to pay.</p>
		<p> So much for the subject regarding its racial or eugenic aspect. Now let us see what are
			the objections raised by our opponents.</p>
		<p> Their first cry is that it is against the laws of <name type="deity">God</name>. They
			refer to the biblical command of “increase and multiply and replenish the earth.” This
			command has already been fulfilled. “To replenish” means to “stock abundantly.”
			“Abundant” means “plenty.” “Plenty” means “enough”– “A sufficiency”. So there we see
			that as far as that command goes to the individual working man and woman their job has
			been done. There were only eight people on the earth when the command was last given.
			Today there are approximately 8 thousand millions.</p>
		<p> But the other half of that command is seldom quotes. It should read “Increase and
			multiply and replenish the earth that ye shall have dominion over all things.”
			“Dominion” means “authority”, “rule”, “control” over one’s own powers including
			fertility or the powers of reproduction.</p>
		<p> The next objection raised by the opposition is: that Birth Control is against the laws
			of nature. Here is the most inconsistent and unreasoning assertion that any group living
			in the year of 1932 can make. The laws of nature! Poor old Nature! What exactly are her
			laws? The opposition assumes that certain organs like the stomach and sex organs make
			certain demands and these demands must be fulfilled, but these two organs are not the
			limit of nature’s demands. We have another organ– a brain. To use this brain, to use our
			intelligence, mind, reason, judgment, powers of choice and criticism, is just as
			important a part of nature’s machinery as to use the stomach and generative organs for
			nature’s needs.</p>
		<p> The very instinct of self-preservation and defense in applying Birth Control to protect
			health and family happiness is nature’s own weapon.</p>
		<p> The inconsistencies of objecting to birth control on the claim that is it against the
			laws of nature, are obvious when we see the very group making the strongest objections
			are bachelors who have never followed nature’s best law of mating, nor God’s law to
			increase and multiply. In every way of modern life these same people have violated
			nature’s laws for their own personal advantage and comfort and selfish purpose. They
			shave, they wear glasses, when necessary, they go to dentists, they call doctors and
			surgeons, they ride in motor cars, cook food, they wear long, clumsy, ugly gowns– they
			protect themselves against nature by all the artificial means of our modern
			civilization. By refraining from marriage they thwart one of nature’s oldest laws–
			mating. Their right to sublimate this force for their religious development is no more
			natural than to sublimate it in the interest of love and for one’s cultural development,
			as is done by the practice of birth control in family life.</p>
		<p> When the opposition’s logic is challenged regarding God’s and Nature’s laws and the
			self-control argument met squarely, there is the usual shifting over to morals.</p>
		<p> “Yes, but what about the morals of our young people,” they query. If knowledge of birth
			control is made legal what will prevent boys and girls from getting it and using such
			knowledge for promiscuous sex relations?</p>
		<p> The assumption in this remark is that fear of pregnancy is the only thing that keeps
			young men and women from cohabiting today. That ignorance and fear are the safeguards to
			morality. Is this the case? I do not believe it is true in the lives of the majority of
			women, though it may be true in certain cases where there is already a tendency to
			looseness in character.</p>
		<p> There is nothing in birth control knowledge itself that can be called immoral. It is the
			use or misuse of knowledge which classes it as good or bad, like the use of misuse of
			any power or invention: razors, knives, guns, drugs or alcohol.</p>
		<p> But back of the use or abuse of knowledge and power is the person. That is where we must
			begin to work if we would avoid abuses.</p>
		<p> If the Christian Church after 2000 years of teaching morals through fear of punishment
			and hell fire has not succeeded in keeping people moral, then I suggest they keep out of
			legislative, congressional halls, and give common sense, education and science a chance
			for a while. Eliminate fear and ignorance in youth. Increase scientific knowledge,
			develop confidence and self-respect, and morality will take care of itself.</p>
		<p> Along with this inconsistent claim of nature comes a partial acquiescence in the
			practice of birth control by the opponents. It is one of their most astounding
			statements of ignorance and inconsistency. Birth Control? Yes, of course, but only by
			“self-control” they say. Now let us inquire what “self-control” can mean in relation to
			marriage. We are then told that there is a period of several days in a woman’s sex cycle
			when it is not possible for her to conceive, but during that period it is not sinful for
			her to have sexual union. In other words, nature aims to close temporarily the gates of
			life by woman’s diminishing sex desire. In the first place, it is by no means a fact
			that all women have a so-called “safe period.” It is generally a greed that less than
			one percent of women can claim a “safe period.” In the second place, this is likely to
			be the period when there is no desire on the part of the woman for sex communion. It is
			the period when she should <emph rend="underlined">not</emph> be encouraged to have
			intercourse at all, for should she become pregnant at this period when her sex curve is
			low, she has less vitality to give to the child she may conceive and thereby violates
			one of nature’s obvious laws to protect weakened offspring from being born into the
			world.</p>
		<p> If sex union is limited to the purpose of reproduction <emph rend="underlined"
				>only</emph>, then a healthy married couple must consider the number of children
			they may properly rear and decently educate and confine sexual behavior to rigid rules,
			as the stock breedor controls his cattle. If a loving young couple decide to marry at
			the age of 23-25 with prospects of earning a good wage of $50. a week, they count the
			cost of living and decide they will be generous to the race by bringing four children
			into the world and making decent citizens of them.</p>
		<p> The first year brings the baby into their home and if they are true to the command that
			intercourse should only be indulged in for reproduction, all affectionate sexual
			behavior should cease after the first recognition that the woman is pregnant, (or after
			the first month of marriage.) Absolute continence should then be the rule in that
			household if they accept that principle and, furthermore, there should be strict rules
			adhered to concerning sex behavior on the part of either husband or wife which would
			incline either to weaken in their discipline.</p>
		<p> Thus, they would abstain not only from intercourse, but from all demonstration of
			passion or affection. No kissing, no hugging, no cuddling. Separate rooms, separate
			beds, separate baths. No tender compliments, no lingering affectionate looks, no holding
			of hands; nothing shall be done in act or word to arouse sex love or the sex emotions in
			that continent home until such time as they know they can welcome another pregnancy and
			care for another baby!</p>
		<p> Thus, over a period of twenty-two years, when both are full of vigor, when life and love
			and passion are at its height, these two persons are forbidden to commune in body and
			soul through sexual intercourse more than four or five times throughout their
			twenty-five reproductive years. “Dost thou like the picture?”</p>
		<p> The colossal arrogance of any religious group to demand such conduct within marriage is
			beyond my understanding. The rules of the monastery and nunneries may be very well for
			single persons dedicating all their forces to religious fervor, but to lay down the same
			rules for married lovers within the home is so absurd and futile that one wonders how it
			can be countenanced by so-called intelligent people.</p>
		<p> I take issue with those who claim that sex mating is solely for the purpose of
			reproduction.</p>
		<p> It is a result, as we all know, but I am yet to be convinced that it is <emph
				rend="underlined">the cause</emph>. If one analyses the facts a little one must
			concede that sex attraction is almost never accompanied by the wish to be a parent. Nor
			during the sex act itself seldom is there any desire to conceive. It’s the exception,
			rather than the rule, even among most primitive tribes. Barren women, pregnant women,
			sterile men and women have sex desires. The sex urge is as old as life itself. It is a
			tremendous thing. It is a wonderful, beautiful thing if we will but make it so. It is a
			force which cannot be swept back nor crushed down without damage to the individual. It
			should be accepted with reverence and pride, not connected with shame. Upon it we should
			build a race beautiful of body, sound of mind, and conscious of its power and
			responsibility.</p>
		<p> The new day is dawning.</p>
		<p> A new civilization is in the making. Ignorance of sex force– creative energy already has
			given way to knowledge and enlightenment. Parenthood– conscious, enlightened and
			responsible, shall become a proud commission to carry on the torch of illumination to
			the new race. Birth Control information should be the right of every adult man and
			women. It should be their privilege to go to the medical profession to obtain the proper
			suitable methods for prevention of conception. It should be the woman’s right to have
			knowledge, not because she is sick, diseased, or poor, but because as a woman whose body
			must be used in the creating and incubating of the new life, she should be given the
			right of choice, and time, consistent with her desires.</p>
		<p> The laws as they stand today insult our intelligence and our morals. They debase love.
			Poor women are Conscripted to child-bearing, in ignorance and fear, by the laws of the
			United States Government. They have no choice. All avenues of knowledge are closed to
			them. They must bear, regardless of consequences to their own health, to the welfare of
			the children, or to the husbands’ ability to provide for them.</p>
		<p> Wasted lives of women– tortured and broken in child-bearing. Twelve children born– three
			alive, twenty pregnancies with five children to show for the waste. It’s barbarous, it’s
			inhuman, it’s a waste of woman power and child life. Who gains by this? Does the church
			which opposes knowledge gain power thus? Who pays for it? The women pay for it, my
			friends. They pay personally and directly for this in infant and maternal mortality, in
			child labor, in wasted bodies, futile pregnancies, still born babies, and abortions. In
			ignorance she brings forth her children and is enslaved as the black race never was
			enslaved. Where is another <person rend="Lincoln, Abraham">Abraham Lincoln</person> to
			free her? </p>
