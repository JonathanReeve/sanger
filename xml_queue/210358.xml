		<head>An Open Letter to Social Workers</head>
		<byline><emph rend="italics">From</emph> Margaret Sanger</byline>
		<p>In addressing this letter to the assembled delegates of the <org>National Conference of
				Social Work</org>, I do so with a feeling of kinship in a common purpose. Too often
			I find an <person reg="Alice in Wonderland (fictional)"
				>Alice-in-Wonderland</person> attitude prevailing–-with poverty, disease and kindred
			evils all seen as through a looking-glass, as spectres without substance. To the social
			worker, however, these are grim realities, calling on every ounce of courage,
			resourcefulness and commonsense in their solution.</p>
		<p> You who have dedicated yourselves to the welfare of others-–you who are working to build
			bridges for families to pass from dependency to self-support-–know full well that a
			knowledge of birth control must form the keystone of that bridge. You are already aware
			of the futility of pouring untold millions into palliative measures that disregard the
			obvious fact that without birth control, no permanent adjustment is possible between the
			size of a family and the family income.</p>
		<p> A unique responsibility is today vested in the social workers of <place
				rend="United States">America</place>, as a result of the gigantic increases that
			have taken place in the cost of public and private charities. For you are the
			intermediaries between the diseased, the defectives, the delinquent, and the dependent,
			and the vast agencies charged with the administrative responsibility of spending
			billions of dollars from public and private funds to help these groups. It is upon your
			recommendations that organization policies are established; and such policies must be
			reconciled with constructive race-building. Upon your vision, upon your intelligence, in
			this crisis, rests the welfare not only of countless troubled, worried parents, but also
			of the children born in the midst of the greatest depression in history, on whom we
			depend to carry on the torch of civilization.</p>
		<p> I want to express my gratitude to the large and increasing number of individual social
			workers who are courageously bringing a knowledge of birth control to families crushed
			under the burden of feeding and clothing a constantly increasing family upon a
			stationary or diminishing wage. Through your efforts many mothers have been enabled to
			secure scientific information from dependable medical sources. Our common problem today
			is: How can we make it possible for every mother to obtain this help? How can we break
			the vicious circle of overlarge families, poverty, infant and maternal mortality, child
			labor, marital discord, prostitution, and other social cankers all linking up directly
			to the difficulty of obtaining information so essential to the health of these mothers?
			How can we stop the senseless perpetuation of these evils?</p>
		<p> Birth control clinics in every community are essential. These can be established under
			present State Laws, and can operate within certain limitations of the State Statutes. In
			24 states no legal restrictions exist, and contraceptive advice can be given mothers for
			economic and social reasons as well as for health reasons. There are 133 birth control
			centers legally operating throughout this country. The present Federal Laws, however,
				<name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Sections 211</name>,
				<name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 245">245</name>, <name
				type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 311">311</name>, and <name
				type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 312">312 of the Criminal
				Code</name>, class contraception with obscenity and abortion. They make it a
			criminal offense to send or receive from the U.S. mails or common carriers, information
			or supplies pertaining to contraception. They make no exceptions for physicians,
			hospitals or clinics, who are forced to violate the law in order to obtain necessary
			supplies from the manufacturers. Consequently, we have the spectacle of 133 legally
			operating birth control clinics that have become veritable “speak-easies” as far as the
			general public is concerned. It is difficult for the mothers in the communities where
			these clinics are operating almost surreptitiously, to know of their existence, and the
			consequence is that although a mother may live within a few hundred feet of a center,
			she is usually unaware of its existence. On leaving the maternity wards, or applying to
			maternity centres, or lying-in hospitals for such advice it is refused her. Only if she
			can pay the fee of a private physician can she obtain scientific individual instruction.
			For obviously, the physician who takes the personal responsibility of giving
			contraceptive advice in his private office, cannot involve the medical institutions with
			which he is connected in a subject classed by our Federal Statutes as illegal. He is
			compelled to protect himself and his institution in his public practice. It is here that
			the Federal Laws take their greatest toll in keeping in ignorance the most needy mothers
			who are dependent on hospitals, public dispensaries and clinics for their medical aid.
			It is class legislation, a sanction of knowledge for those who can afford to pay for it,
			and ignorance and misery for those who cannot.</p>
		<p>
			<org>The National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org> has sponsored
			legislation in <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> that would exempt
			physicians, medical colleges, hospitals and clinics from the provisions of the above
			Statutes, in order to enable every hospital to legally provide birth control information
			as part of its routine preventative health service. The amendment of the Federal Laws
			represents a “short cut” to bringing this needed relief to the greatest number in the
			shortest possible time. Hearings on our legislation have been held before <org
				reg="United States Senate">Senate</org> and <org
				reg="United States House of Representatives">House</org> Committees. Medical, social
			and religious organizations with memberships approximating many millions of individuals,
			have endorsed these efforts to bring our Federal laws in line with decency and
			commonsense.</p>
		<p> Much remains to be done. You who are in touch with actual conditions are cognizant of
			the need. I am grateful to those among you who have had the courage to take an
			unqualified stand on this question, and who have thrown the weight of your influence
			into persuading the welfare agencies with which you are affiliated to openly endorse the
			work of our Committee. Your leadership is inspiring those who are more timid to do
			likewise. Each individual and group endorsement helps, and is urgently needed for our
			work during the next session of Congress.</p>
		<p> I am also looking to the social workers with their vast experience to help broaden the
			horizon on this important subject. Unfortunately, there are still many who, while
			reluctantly recognizing the need for contraceptive advice in cases of heart disease,
			cancer, tuberculosis, hereditary and transmissible diseases, and other health conditions
			where pregnancy is known to aggravate the disease, sometimes resulting in death,
			nevertheless do not always see the deeper social and ethical principles involved. There
			can be no justification for violating the right of every married woman to decide when
			and how often she shall undertake the physical and far-reaching responsibilities of
			motherhood. It is mediaeval and barbarous to treat parenthood as a punishment for
			shiftlessness or recklessness. On the contrary, the woman sufficiently
			socially-conscious to desire to take parenthood out of the sphere of accident, should be
			aided in obtaining scientific information that will enable her to space the births of
			children in consideration of her health, her husband’s earning capacity, and the future
			health, environmental and educational opportunities for her children. Unless there is
			intelligent direction of the movement, however, we will have continued attempts to
			legislate contraceptive advice into the same category as abortions. Only last week, in
				<place>Connecticut</place>, an incredible bill was introduced, making it necessary
			for a woman to secure the consent of two physicians, one of them recommended by the <org
				reg="Connecticut State Board of Health">State Board of Health</org> and residing in
			an adjacent town, before contraceptive advice could be prescribed. This is an instance
			of the type of shortsighted legislation passed by lawmakers and paid for by the
			people.</p>
		<p>In closing, may I again point out that yours is the responsibility and privilege of
			rendering an unequalled patriotic service to your country by taking a stand that will
			help to forward this constructive work. Birth control is here, it is being practiced, it
			has already done great good. It can relieve the economic distress of countless families.
			Like all great forces, however, it must be directed, it must be accessible to all
			classes, so that it may truly become a constructive force for the regeneration of the
			race. </p>
