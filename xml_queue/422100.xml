			<dateline><place>NEW YORK</place>, <date>Dec. 9</date>.</dateline>
			<p>"<q>Diplomats may form leagues of nations but so long as women continue to produce
					explosive populations all the leagues in the world will be merely proverbial
					scraps of paper.</q>" <q who="MCI">Mrs. Margaret Sanger, birth control advocate,
					declared in commenting on the new campaign to legalize dissemination of birth
					control information in this <place reg="New York, NY">state</place>.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="MCI">The campaign was launched at a meeting of 500 women under auspices of
					the <org>New York Women's Publishing Company</org>, publishers of the <title
						type="journal">Birth Control Review</title>. Mrs. Sanger, who just returned
					from studying social conditions in <place>Europe</place>, bore the following
					message to American women from European scientists, diplomats and
					economists:</q>
			</p>
			<p>"<q>We agree with the advocates of birth control that no world peace is possible
					without a reduction of the birth rate and immediate action toward its
					international accomplishment.</q>"</p>
			<p>
				<q who="MCI">A bill legalizing dissemination of birth control information will be
					introduced at the next session of the <org reg="New York State Legislature"
						>legislature</org>.</q>
			</p>

				<q who="BDE">Mrs. <person reg="Rublee, Juliet Barrett">Juliet Barrett
						Rublee</person> presided and introduced Mrs. Sanger. The latter, who is an
					attractive young woman with a clear cut, colorless face and dark eyes, wore a
					black cloth gown edged with fur at the throat and a close-fitting turban of ecru
					and black feathers.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"<q>I understood,</q>" <q who="BDE">she said,</q> "<q>that a scientific contraceptive
					has been invented in <place>Germany</place> which would solve the problem for
					all time. I did not find it, but I got in touch with scientists in
						<place>Germany</place>, <place reg="Netherlands">Holland</place> and
						<place>England</place>, and owing to communications established between
					these countries I believe such an ideal thing will be here, possibly within the
					year, for our benefit.</q>"</p>
			<p>"<q>The time has come to apply fundamentals to the world's wounds. Birth control is
					the step which we must take to ensure world peace. Women who continue to produce
					explosive populations will make all pledges of peace between nations become so
					many scraps of paper.</q>"</p>
			<p>"<q>Birth control is not a new idea. It is as old as Nature itself. Nature has used
					famine and pestilence and disease to wipe out the unfit. But today we protect
					the unfit in our hospitals and seek to use science rather than Nature's cruel
					method. Today, because we have checked Nature's method and are not using the
					scientific method of birth control the world is in a condition of congestion,
					misery and poverty.</q>"</p>

			<head type="sub">Problem of Congestion.</head>
			<p>"<q>Scientists, diplomats, statesmen and reformers--we are disappointed in them all.
					There is not a nation today which is not dissatisfied with its government. We
					must attack this problem of congestion fundamentally.</q>"</p>
			<p>
				<q who="BDE">About three-fourths of the audience left at the conclusion of Mrs.
					Sanger's speech.</q>
