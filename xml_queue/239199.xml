		<head>To Our Friends</head>
		<p>This is a most significant hour, important to our civilization, vital to unborn
			generations. One of the leading goals of our movement, a controlled population, is in
			sight. The <org reg="International Committee on Planned Parenthood">International
				Planned Parenthood Committee</org> is bombarded with requests for films, literature,
			supplies, information--everything to aid groups and individuals to organize educational
			campaigns to spur official action and raise funds for birth control centers. These
			voluntary groups are eager to pioneer, to enlighten their own citizens in the techniques
			of spacing pregnancies and controlling birth rates. They need help, encouragement, the
			assurance that they are not struggling in isolation. To that end we offer this modest
			monthly report. We want your cooperation, support, and news of activities
			everywhere.</p>
