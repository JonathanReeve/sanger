		<head>Politicians vs. Birth Control</head>
		<p>Advocates of Birth Control must possess the power to face facts and to analyze them. Only
			upon the basis of tested experience and actual scientific knowledge can we overcome the
			ignorance, the stupidity and the prejudices which are the only formidable forces
			standing in our way. Our recent legislative campaign at <place reg="Albany, NY">
				Albany</place>, an account of which may be found on another page of this number, has
			revealed in striking fashion the antagonistic attitude of the typical American
			politician to the pivotal problem of society today. To expect aid or even intelligent
			understanding of Birth Control from the typical Albany politician; to be disappointed
			because of the ignorance of these so-called "legislators;" to be discouraged because of
			their failure to remove the coercive and criminally obscene insult to American womanhood
			from the statute books--this would be to succumb to emotion rather than to profit by the
			knowledge, the invaluable knowledge, we have gained from our experience at Albany. The
			great fact is this: we can expect nothing of the politician of today. If we must use the
			weapon of politics to further the progress of Birth Control, it must be the politics
			created by ourselves.</p>
		<p>When the first Birth Control clinic in <place reg="United States"> America</place> was
			declared a "public nuisance," by the courts, we were advised by well-meaning friends
			that the legal way, the political way, the legislative way, was the only safe and sane
			method of propaganda. This has now been put to the test. And we discover that the
			successful politician is not only mentally unable to understand the aim of Birth
			Control, but, moreover, he himself is the very product of those sinister forces we are
			aiming to eradicate from human society.</p>
		<p>As manifested in the United States today, current politics is the very outgrowth of
			overcrowding and underfeeding: mental and physical. Your successful politician is the
			demagogue who knows the best tricks to catch the greatest number of votes. He is the
			hypnotist of great, docile, submissive, sheep-like majorities. He is interested in
			number, not intelligence. Therefore, to expect such masters who, by hook or crook, ride
			roughshod into public office or slide into seats of the state legislature to understand
			or support a program which aims at the creation of self-reliant, self-governing
			independent men and women, would be to neglect one of the most important factors among
			the resources of our opponents. But we did at least expect something more among men
			elected to public office than the embarrassed giggle of the adolescent, the cynical
			indecency of the gangster, in the consideration of a serious sexual and social
			problem.</p>
		<p>Perhaps, moreover, we failed to take into consideration the vast power wielded today by
			the politicians in the control and administration of the public charities, hospitals and
			"correctional" institutions. Politician and office-holder indirectly benefit through
			these institutions for the support and maintenance of the victims of compulsory
			motherhood. Impartial statistics make this evident. Exclusive of privately supported
			industries and charities, New York City alone spends annually approximately sixteen
			million dollars to maintain its various departments of charities, hospitals and
			"corrections." In 146 of the largest American cities, the total expenditure for the
			support of the dependent population amounts annually to no less than fifty millions of
			dollars.</p>
		<p>Our politicians today profit from human misery. They have an interest, direct or
			indirect, in the production through uncontrolled fecundity, of the unfit, the underfed,
			the feebleminded and the incurably diseased. Their interest, financially, is in the
			increase of our institution populations, with their insistent demands for appropriations
			from the city and state, as well as their unending appeals to public and private
			sentimental generosity. Most eugenists dub the victims of out legal and social barbarism
			"the unfit." But as <person reg="Bateson, William">William Bateson</person> has recently
			shown, we need to revise and re-interpret our definition of the "unfit." The victims are
			not the "unfit," but these blind leaders of the blind--the politician, the profiteer,
			the war-making patriot, the criminal moralist who is urging men and women to "<q
				who="BIB"> increase and multiply</q>." "<q who="BATWI">The crimes of the prison
				population</q>," declared Professor Bateson in his recent <person
				reg="Galton, Francis"> Galton</person> lecture, "<q who="BATWI"> are petty offences
				by comparison, and the significance we attach to them is a survival of other days.
				Felonies may be great offences locally, but they do not induce catastrophes. The
				proclivities of the war-makers are infinitely more dangerous than those of the
				beings whom from time to time the law may dub as criminals. <emph rend="italics"
					>Consistent and portentous selfishness, combined with dullness of imagination
					are probably just as transmissible as want of self-control, though destitute of
					the amiable qualities not rarely associated with the genetic composition of
					persons of unstable mind.</emph></q>"</p>
		<p>In delegating important powers to near-sighted, unimaginative, politicians and
			acquisitive office-grabbers, the American public is submitting, with deplorable
			docility, to every sort of injurious and grossly coercive legislation. Laws are passed
			as penalties for those who dare to disagree with us. Our passivity in this respect is in
			effect placing upon the shoulders of the next generation not merely the helpless victims
			of indiscriminate and uncontrolled breeding, but the political parasites who wax so fat
			on the public charities and "corrections," who, consciously or unconsciously, aim to
			foster and uphold this disastrous custom of compulsory motherhood.</p>
		<p>How closely bound up with the enfranchisement of the mentally deficient is the
			deterioration of American politics and politicians is indicated in <person
				reg="Ireland, Alleyne">Alleyne Ireland's</person> recent study of the situation,
				"<title type="book">Democracy and the Human Equation</title>." Mr. Ireland is
			inevitably driven to the conclusion that there must be some improvement in the quality
			of the American voter and the American politician before we can expect anything of
			political action. The only hope he discovers on the horizon is eugenics. But eugenics is
			futile and impractical, a vague flapping of wings, unless it is allied and strengthened
			by Birth Control. Otherwise eugenics can only suggest a cradle competition between the
			"fit" and the "unfit." In this mad race in over-population, the fit would very soon
			become the unfit; and we would be on the road to a universal imbecility.</p>
		<p>Thus we face the interesting possibility--a vision that should give us new strength and
			coverage: If politicians cannot and will not help Birth Control, Birth Control must and
			will improve politics.</p>
		<p>The most amazing aspect of the present situation is to be found in the great overwhelming
			fact that the women of America, especially the mothers of America, are demanding the sex
			hygiene and education which the practice of Birth Control would bring to them. Letters
			from the over-burdened mothers reach us in thousands; typical examples are presented in
			issues of the <title type="journal"
				 reg="Birth Control Review">REVIEW</title>. Superficial critics often remark
			that it is impossible to carry the message of Birth Control to the women who need it
			most. This claim is belied in all the heart-rending appeals from the victims of
			barbarous laws and outworn prejudices. If these indomitable and courageous mothers were
			finally freed from the bondage of compulsory maternity, we should witness the gradual
			but certain lifting of the curse of the "unfit" and the subnormal. It is the pressure,
			the ceaseless constant pressure upon American womanhood that is productive of the
			subnormal and mentally defective. This cursed section of humanity is not a matter of
			chance. It is the inevitable result of a pressure upon the normal and healthy, a
			pressure--or cramping restriction--that must somewhere find its outlet.</p>
		<p>What the reactionary politicians fail to recognize is that human society possesses in
			itself, if it were not impeded by outworn customs and barbarous laws, the power of
			regeneration, of recreation. More and more evidence is coming to light that the number
			of enlightened and intelligent women is increasing. American women are realizing that
			first and foremost the problem of bringing children into this world is a personal and
			physical one. They are refusing to submit any longer to the self-appointed dictatorship
			of the politician, who, instead of clearing the way for the great march of civilization,
			is attempting to impede progress by defending decrepit statute and writing into the laws
			of the land coercive measures.</p>
		<p>When women awaken to the necessity of organizing a political method of their own, instead
			of relying upon or expecting understanding and help from the man-made brand, the
			politician as he expresses himself today will no longer be tolerated, and with the even
			of self-reliance and self-government, the race of politicians will, fortunately for
			humanity, become as extinct as that of the dinosaur.</p>
