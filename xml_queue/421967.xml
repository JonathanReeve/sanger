		<head>FAMILY PLANNING: Mrs. Margaret Sanger's Lecture On Birth
			Control</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p><q who="SCMP">A plea for birth control as the most practical
					means for regulating population in accordance with economics
					and hygiene was made by Mrs Margaret Sanger,
					internationally-famous authority on the subject, in a
					lecture sponsored by the <org
						reg="Family Planning Association of Hong Kong">Hongkong
						Family Planning Association</org> at <org>St. John's
						Cathedral Hal</org>l yesterday.</q></p>
			<p><q who="SCMP">More than 200 people packed the limited hall to
					hear her view on the controversial subject. Mrs. Sanger is
					en route to <place reg="Bombay, India">Bombay</place> to
					attend the <org
						reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 3rd"
						>Third International Conference on Planned
						Parenthood</org> to be held later this month.</q></p>

			<p><q who="SCMP">In the talk she repeated most of the opinions she
					has held for a number of years, and which she had occasion
					recently to expound in <place>Japan</place>. She based her
					argument on the fact that the conception of life was a great
					responsibility, entailing care on the part of parents to
					plan their families instead of proceeding about it in a
					haphazard fashion.</q></p>
			<p><q who="SCMP">She described birth control as the conscious
					control of the birth rate by means of prevention of
					conception, in accordance with the fundamental need to
					consider the mother's heath, the father's economic
					potentialities, the environment of the offspring and their
					proper place in society.</q></p>
			<p><q who="SCMP">Mrs. Sanger denied the argument of some religious
					circles who claimed that birth control meant the murder of
					children. She said that prevention of conception involved no
					interference with life, as no life began until conception
					had taken place. This was strictly in accordance with the
					facts of biology.</q></p>
			<p><q who="SCMP">She said she was delighted to note the sound
					organisation and leadership of the Hongkong Family Planning
					Association because of the significant nature of its work,
					and appealed for more support for it. Every individual had a
					responsibility in the movement for birth control, she
					declared, because family planning could well be the
					foundation of society.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Over-Population</head>
			<p><q who="SCMP">She deplored the current trend towards
					over-population with its attendant deterioration of national
					health and hygiene, poising the inference that birth control
					really meant a striving for better national welfare.</q></p>
			<p><q who="SCMP">Mrs. Sanger said that in the case of mothers their
					periods of pregnancy should be so spaced that no danger to
					health from such ailments as tuberculosis could be incurred,
					and among younger people, all the aspects of family
					responsibility should be fully considered and appreciated
					before the arrival of the first baby.</q></p>
			<p><q who="SCMP">This would tend to promote more security, more
					affection, and in effect a fuller and happier family
					life.</q></p>
			<p><q who="SCMP">Her work in this field, she said, had been
					justified in many countries since she began it in 1914, and
					two nations, Japan and <place>India</place>, had adopted
					birth control officially.</q></p>
			<p><q who="SCMP">The speaker was introduced to the gathering by
					Professor <person reg="King, Gordon">Gordon King</person>,
					Chairman of the Hongkong Family Planning Association, who
					said there existed at present, considerable demand in the
						<place reg="Hong Kong">Colony</place> for the
					Association's advice and help.</q></p>
