		<p>Help for the childless couple has been one the research projects in the <org
				reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">National</org> &amp; <org
				reg="International Planned Parenthood Federation">International Planned
				Parenthood</org> Movement, <add>ever</add>
			<del>in this country as well as in <place>England</place></del> since the Movement
			began. It is interesting to note that both Fertility &amp; Infertility Research had
			little attention by either the Medical or Scientific specialists until fairly recently.
			Today they seem to parallel each other in a race to meet the demands of our
				<add>growing</add> intelligent public. The term Birth Control used in the Early days
			of the PP movement signified its principle of Control--(not limitation) of the birth
			rate by wanting to space their pregnancies &amp; to encourage &amp; help
				<add>childless</add> women to become mothers.</p>
