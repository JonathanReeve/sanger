		<head>The Vision of George Drysdale</head>
		<byline>By Margaret Sanger</byline>
		<p>The revelation in modern psychology, for which we are mostly indebted to <person
				reg="Freud, Sigmund">Sigmund Freud</person>, is marked by the shifting emphasis and
			interest from the intellectual to the instinctive, from the descriptive to the
			behavioristic. It is based upon the application of scientific determination to the
			mental sphere. It tends to become more and more physiological and biological. It reveals
			the human mind as subject to natural automatic processes, with sex as the unconscious
			dynamic and motivating force in all the more important phases of human behavior. <person
				reg="Drysdale, George">Drysdale</person> was not merely a vague precursor of this
			modern point of view. Though his contribution in this field is slight, he realized the
			absolute interdependence of bodily and mental health, and cried out for a creative and
			illuminating psychology which might free individuals from their invisible chains. It was
			because of his insistence that this realm must be studied as scientifically as the human
			body, and his belief that mental science must be free of all theoretical and
			metaphysical tradition, that he may be called one of the true founders of the new
			psychology.</p>
		<p>The spiritual and the physical life of man, he pointed out, are organically united. The
			one cannot be understood without the other. The physical enters equally with the psychic
			element in every human question. Insanity and all mental disease, of which there is a
			particular diseased bodily state to correspond with each one; should all come, he felt,
			under the patient investigation of the scientist. Drysdale foresaw the present
			development in psychology in indicating that the true analyst must be familiar not only
			with physical habits, but with mental habits also. Just as psycho-analysts are able to
			substantiate and illuminate their discoveries by examples drawn from literature and art,
			history and biography, so Drysdale pointed out that in studying human nature the
			scientists, to understand the general cause of health and disease, must become
			acquainted with the world of creative expression. True scientists "<q who="DRYGE">should
				seek to enter into the thoughts of religious and moral thinkers; for all of them are
				in their own sphere physicians, and their every thought has a physical and moral
				import.</q>" To make any advance in this field, he pointed out, perseverance and the
			combined effort of many workers are needed. Medicine must be combined with other
			sciences, and, until the public is as well informed on physical as on psychic subjects
			and as thoroughly conversant with their paramount importance, we cannot expect any true
			progress.</p>
		<p>He also saw the advance of the method of analysis, in encouraging the patient to reveal
			himself. Any true understanding of mental disease or unbalance, he felt would be barren
			and incomplete without this self-revelation, just as morality and religion were barren
			and incomplete before men began to think on these subjects for themselves. He deplored
			the fact that very few medical men had ever thought of allowing their patients to speak
			for themselves in their diagnoses. Intent on arriving at physical facts and physical
			conclusions, physicians of his day paid apparently little attention to the mental state
			of the patient, which, as he pointed out, forms no less a part of the disease. In
			questioning a patient they sought to bring him as soon as possible to the physical
			point, "<q who="DRYGE">
				<emph rend="italics">checking his digressions and the out-pouring of his suffering
					heart.</emph></q>" On the other hand, the psychology of that artificial era was
			as barren and unfruitful, as we could well expect it to be. It limited itself, as any
			reader of the old textbooks remembers, to descriptive analysis of intellectual and
			mental processes, with no reference to the unconscious physical or instinctive behavior
			of the individual.</p>
		<p>Drysdale was one of the first to see that these two things, to be of any real benefit to
			humanity, must be united and synthesized into a new science. The modern analyst has to
			base his therapy upon the ever-increasing revelations the individual is able to make.
			Drysdale foresaw some such method as this by speaking of the value of the patient's
			digressions, <emph rend="italics">confessions and outpourings</emph>. He realized that
			the physician and science were losing in a great degree not only by the silencing of the
			feelings, but also by their lack of insight into the psychology of health and disease.
			This, he insisted, is as valuable a part of medical knowledge as any other, and as
			important for the prevention and treatment of disease and the advancement of health.
			Every physical state has its peculiar mental one, and to discover what this is, and the
			influence on the mind of all bodily states, such as hysteria and insanity, is a most
			essential branch of medicinal science. This psychology of health and disease is to be
			obtained only by a study of every individual's mind compared with his bodily condition,
			and a full knowledge of this can be arrived at only by <emph rend="italics">his own
				revelations. We want a whole man to sympathize with, not merely a body or a
				soul.</emph></p>
		<p>"<q who="DRYGE">How few subjective records of physical life are to be found in
				history!</q>" he exclaimed. "<q who="DRYGE">Among the numerous autobiographies that
				have been written by so many noble human beings, who has given us any but the most
				meager details of his physical life, even though its history may have been the most
				extraordinary, the most sadly eventful of the twin parts of his nature? Hence do all
				these men present to us most imperfect pictures. Through all the tissues of their
				loves we do not know what physical threads have been interwoven, and therefore we
				can pass no satisfactory judgment on themselves or their actions. But how immensely
				does the world lose by not having the fruits of their physical as well as their
				moral experiences! Had their penetrating minds been as keenly directed to the
				physical goods and evils they encountered as to the mental ones, had they used, each
				in his own case, the subtle insight which personal experience alone gives, would the
				world have been in as wretched state as it is, with so low a physical standard that
				health is not health, that there is a skeleton in every house, and a disease, secret
				or open, gnawing at the vitals of almost every one of us! Would we still be
				stumbling on from age to age in the same erroneous tracks, and falling one after the
				other, like sheep, into the same physical pitfalls?...</q></p>
		<p>"<q who="DRYGE">If we will not remain thus ignorant, we must imbue our minds equally with
				physical knowledge. We must study the language of the body, a language not confined
				to an age or a nation, but wide and universal as humanity, in order that we may
				attain to a higher self-consciousness.</q>"</p>
		<p>He reverts time after time, in the "<title type="book">Elements of Social
				Science,</title>" to this necessity of a new psychology. One chapter is entitled
				"<title type="book">Subjective Medicine,</title>" another "<title>Mental
				Disease</title>," while another chapter on hysteria seems to me to be fundamentally
			in agreement with the epoch-making study of Freud, published in 1895, the first book of
			the great Viennese pioneer. In his chapter on "<title>Mental Disease</title>," George
			Drysdale points out that the mind, exactly like the body, operates according to fixed
			natural laws. Sorrow in the mind corresponds to pain in the body. In Freud's first book
					"<title><foreign lang="GER">Studien Ã¼ber Hysterie</foreign></title>" the point
			was made that "<q who="FRESI">sexuality plays a leading part in the causation of
				hysteria.</q>" When we recall that <person reg="Charcot, Jean Martin"
				>Charcot</person> was indifferent to the psychic side of his cases, that he regarded
			the recognition of a sex element in the causation of disease as degrading, and that
			Freud and <person reg="Breuer, Josef">Breuer</person> in 1895 first launched the
			doctrine of sexual suppression, which is now the foundation pier upon which the whole
			structure of the new psychology rests, we can gain some sense of Drysdale's importance
			as the true pioneer of the whole modern outlook.</p>
		<p>Verification of this fact is to be strikingly found in his chapter on mental disease and
			hysteria. He makes the unqualified statement that a morbid sexual state--both physical
			and mental--lies at the root of hysteria. Compare this with the statement made by Freud
			in his first book that "<q who="FRESI">the great majority of serious neuroses in women
				arise from the marriage bed.</q>" With none of the equipment of modern psychology
			and modern science at his command. Drysdale nevertheless reveals a definite and concrete
			insight, stated in unequivocal terms, concerning the hysterical and neurotic character.
			He asks us to analyse the peculiar mental and physical phenomena of hysteria, and to
			consider the disturbing influences which the systematic denial and repression of natural
			desire must have on the delicate and susceptible girl. He says it is impossible to avoid
			the conclusion that this suppression is the main cause of the disease: "<q who="DRYGE"
				>The natural emotions are checked and thrown back upon themselves, and it is
				inevitable that they should become disordered and their disorder gradually implicate
				the whole nervous system.</q>" How closely he anticipates the very phraseology of
			the twentieth century psychology is indicated in this striking statement: "<q
				who="DRYGE">The stream of feeling, instead of being allowed to flow onward in its
				natural channel in the light of day, gladdening and fertilizing all around, is pent
				up in <emph rend="italics">the gloomy secret caverns of the mind</emph>, to cause
				there a deluge and desolation. That, which should have been the young girl's pride
				and delight, becomes her shame and torture; she must conceal and studiously repress
				her eager and beautiful emotions; and can we wonder that bewilderment and timidity
				and impotence result? Nature cannot bear this constant state of slavery, and ever
				and anon she shows in the hysterical convulsions, in the wild delirious excitement
				of nymphomania, that she will not be repressed.</q>" He realized that an age of
			spiritual Puritanism and repression was responsible for the inevitable spread of
			hysteria and the increasing numbers of neurotic women. He saw that rank and morbid
			growth of sexual passions was the outgrowth of these suppressions. Happiness is a sign
			of moral health; joy and sorrow, according to Drysdale, are our guides to truth showing
			us where we are right and where wrong in the exploration of our being. He saw long
			before the advance of modern psychology that the mental element plays as important a
			part as any other in the causation of physical disease; and to cure the latter, it is
			just as requisite to apply remedies to the mental as to the bodily state. To do this, he
			said, we must first be able to recognize what is the mental disease and then to treat it
			according to the principles of mental health. Our ignorance of the laws of our minds has
			involved us, body and soul, in ruin. People pride themselves on their woes, and glory in
			their contempt of health. Even to-day we have not outgrown this pride in sorrow and
			disease.</p>
		<p>But Drysdale insisted, like the most advanced of modern psycho-biologists, that the human
			body in its interacting mental and physical aspects is the touchstone of moral truth;
			that its health or disease is "<q who="DRYGE">tangible and demonstrable.</q>" We see
			that joy and all the allied feelings are linked most closely with the physical health
			and wellbeing, whereas sorrow and all its miseries cause derangement and ill-health of
			the bodily functions in a measure exactly proportional to their intensity and
			continuance." He saw that the great need of his time, as it is still of our own, was to
			attain a true idea of what is health and what is disease. The physician of mind and body
			cannot effect a cure if there is lurking in the physical or mental system, a disease or
			derangement which is not recognized, and which may be at the bottom of all the symptoms.
			He saw that the true origin of a great many physical diseases is in reality to be found
			in depressed or anxious state of mind. In this way he preceded the modern theories of
			complexes and suppressions, of morbid fears and compulsions. Thus he urged upon
			physicians to pay equal attention to mental disorder and to seek the true roots of
			physical and mental unbalance.</p>
		<p>How wide-spread the action of conventional sexual suppression and repression as
			restrictive and enslaving agencies upon human nature, was fully realized by Drysdale. He
			saw this expressed in a morbid curiosity caused by the dense ignorance and inhibitions,
			which gave rise to the demand for prurient and stupid books published to gratify the
			sexually starved; in the degradation and corruption of minds; in the infantilism and
			underdevelopment of men and women. Because of this childish curiosity and ignorant
			imagination; because of the degraded feeling of mystery, shame or disgust, varied only
			by vulgar pretences of knowingness, the society of his time was grossly perverted on all
			sexual matters.</p>
		<p>Drysdale insisted that the laws of mind are not one whit less definite and invaluable
			than those of the body. He saw that if psychology was to make any advance it must give
			up its metaphysical and supernatural assumptions. There is no thought, no emotion, no
			instinct within us that is not subject to definite mechanisms, as certain and invariable
			as physical or chemical reactions. He realized that the psychology of his day was still
			in a rudimentary and even stagnant state. "<q who="DRYGE">Its very first fundamental
				axioms are not admitted, but all is involved in a paradoxical mystic supernatural
				obscurity.</q>"</p>
		<p>It was his idea that the two great natural guides to the understanding of mental health
			and disease are joy and sorrow, corresponding to the feelings of pain and pleasure in
			the body. The ordinary standards of moral excellence were obviously unhealthy, according
			to Drysdale. Many of the characters most admired by Victorian moralists were to him
			infected with disease. The great crying need in mind as well as body, he insisted, is
			not humility nor spiritual sentiment, but self-reliance, expressive energy and an active
			enjoyment of life--in a word, health. A true enjoyment of moral and spiritual nature,
			Drysdale claimed, could only be obtained by the comparative examination of the minds of
			all living beings and by tracing our faculties upward from their simple expressions in
			the lowest animals to the very most complicated state in humans. Until this is done, he
			was convinced that there could be no real psychology. "<q who="DRYGE">The science of
				comparative psychology,</q>" he wrote, "<q who="DRYGE">though it has yet scarcely an
				existence, opposed as it has been by our narrow conception of the human mind, will
				ultimately be recognized as equally indispensable with comparative anatomy in order
				to attain a true knowledge of our nature.</q>" In this statement we find in Drysdale
			a striking anticipation of the new psychology with its studies of myth, folk-lore and
			primitive man.</p>
