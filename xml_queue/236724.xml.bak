        <head><title type="book">My Gandhi</title> by <person reg="Holmes, John Haynes">J. H.
                Holmes</person></head>
        <p>The interesting story of <add>Mr. Holmes</add> meeting <person reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K."
                >Gandhi</person> is not only delightful in its details but gives one such a vivid
            picture of Mr. Holmes--No one could possibly believe, that one who has met over the
            years thousands &amp; thousands of people from all <unclear reason="illegible"
                >stations</unclear> &amp; from all nations classes &amp; casts confessed to have
            “missed the excitement of <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> great <gap
                reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> because of my reluctance to grasp &amp; seize
            for my own Satisfaction some portion of their meager stores of time &amp; strength.”</p>
        <p> All through the book is this same humility of a great Soul--(as J H H certainly is) not
            only could he not venture or trespass on the time of Gandhi in person but was reluctant
            to take his time in reading his letters. I agree with Mr. Holmes in describing
            Gandhi--not as a King with the material personally &amp; pageantry of a King--“<q
                who="HOLJO">For it was the Spirit not the flesh which clothed this man in more than
                majesty</q>” How splendid that the author met some of Gandhis dearest friends
                <person reg="Slade, Mirabehu">Mirabehu Slade</person>, <person
                reg="Nardu, Lawrence Housman Saronjin">Lawrence Housman Saronjin Nardu</person>, and
            others. <person reg="Nehru, Jawaharlal">Nehru</person> Splendid too that <gap
                reason="illegible" extent="one word"/> his advice Gandhi did not come to <place
                reg="United States">America</place>.</p>
        <p> It was my good fortune to visit Gandhi for three days in 1936 at his ashram at <place
                reg="Wardha, India">Warda</place>. I am forever grateful to Mr. Holmes for sending a
            letter to the Mahatma before my arrival telling him what I was in India to do.</p>
        <p> Even tho Gandhi &amp; I did not see eye to eye on methods to control the birth rate, our
            ideas on nearly every other subject clicked.</p>
        <p> Just after reading <title type="book">My Gandhi</title>--someone kindly sent me <person
                reg="Sheean, Vincent">Vincent Sheean</person>’s book on Gandhi.</p>
        <p> There too one finds a modesty &amp; humility in his approach--which it is good to know
            has feet by two outstanding Americans. </p>
