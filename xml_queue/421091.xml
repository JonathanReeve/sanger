		<head>Dr. Sanger in Rangoon</head>
		<head type="sub">Leader of Birth Control Movement</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="RG"> Dr. Margaret Sanger, internationally recognized as the leader of the
					birth control movement, arrived in <place reg="Rangoon, Burma"
					>Rangoon</place>yesterday from <place>India</place>. This is Dr. Sanger’s first
					visit to India, although she has already visited almost every other country in
					the world.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"Parenthood when it is responsible can be a noble trust, a proud commission, an
				honored assignment--but this can be accomplished only by taking it out of the sphere
				of accident and placing it in the sphere of conscious responsibility. We can then
				trust that every child will be a wanted child, born to its rightful heritage of
				love, care and comfort." <q who="RG">This is Dr. Sanger's message to <place
						reg="Burma">Burma</place>as it has been to every country she has visited,
					since she began her crusade for birth control twenty-one years ago.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Dr. Sanger herself is surprised at the fruitful results of her visit to
					India. She spoke at the <org reg="All-India Women's Conference">All-India
						Women's Conference</org>'s annual meeting at <place reg="Travancore, India"
						>Travancore</place>at the end of December. As a result a resolution was
					passed to ask the municipalities and hospitals in India to give free advice
					concerning birth control and the spacing of children. There were eight-five for
					the resolution and twenty-four against.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Meets <person reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K.">Mr. Gandhi</person></head>
			<p>"Just prior to my departure for <place reg="Burma">Burma</place>, I had an
				interview--a rather prolonged interview, it lasted two days--with Mr. Gandhi," <q
					who="RG">Dr. Sanger said to a <title type="journal">Rangoon Gazette</title>
					reporter. </q>"I was his guest and had a very receptive and hospitable visit. We
				discussed the regulating of the size of the family among the poorer families, for
				the well-to-do are already aware of the various methods and have the means to
				practice them. The children of the poor only come into this world to die off in
				large numbers. Mr. Gandhi agreed that there should be regulation of families, but we
				differed as to methods to achieve this. He was of the opinion that the correct
				method was continence. I opposed him, and said that, although this might be
				practicable in small groups who could sublimate their energies, it was not for the
				greater masses in their humdrum every day existence. I put forward my arguments to
				support my statement against continence and said that I thought birth control was
				much more scientific, less injurious and more conducive to the happiness of the
				whole family."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Dr. Sanger will leave tomorrow for <place reg="Singapore"
						>Singapore</place>. She hopes to meet medical men in Rangoon and, if
					possible, to organize a meeting.</q>
			</p>

		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">
				<q who="RG">A Romantic Career</q>
			</head>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Mrs. Sanger has had a career which without exaggeration has been
					romantic. She was born in <place reg="Corning, NY">a small factory town in
							<place reg="New York">New York State</place>.</place> Of Irish
					parentage, she was the sixth in a family of eleven children. On her <person
						reg="Higgins, Anne Purcell">mother</person>’s side she is related to the
					famous translator of <person reg="Khayyam, Omar">Omar Kheyyani</person>, <person
						reg="Fitzgerald, Edward">Edward Fitzgerald</person>; her <person
						reg="Higgins, Michael Hennessey">father</person> was a Civil War veteran, a
					liberal, and a philosopher.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">The American fight for birth control was launched by Margaret Sanger in
					1914 when she invented the phrase "birth control," launched the "<title
						type="journal" reg="The Woman Rebel">Woman Rebel</title>" magazine, and founded <org
						reg="Birth Control League of America">the first birth control organization
						in America</org>.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">The "<title type="journal" reg="The Woman Rebel">Woman Rebel</title>" was suppressed, and Mrs.
					Sanger was indicted by the <org reg="United States Government">Federal
						Government</org>. Between her indictment and appearance for trial, she
					studied in <place reg="England">England</place> and <place reg="Netherlands"
						>Holland</place>, grounding herself in the social and economic aspects of
					the question and learning methods in the birth control clinics of Holland. In
					England her case aroused such sympathy that a letter in her behalf was addressed
					to <person reg="Wilson, Woodrow">President Wilson</person>President Wilson by
						<person reg="Bennett, Arnold">Arnold Bennett</person>, <person
						reg="Murray, Gilbert">Gilbert Murray</person>, <person reg="Wells, H. G."
						>H.G. Wells</person>, and other prominent people. When she returned home for
					trial, protests poured in to the <person reg="Clayton, Henry Delamar"
						>judge</person> and to the President, and in the face of this support, the
					case was dropped.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">
				<q who="RG">Opens Clinic </q>
			</head>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Her next move was to test the New York State law by opening a clinic in
					the slum section of <place reg="Brooklyn, NY">Brooklyn</place>in 1916. As a
					trained nurse she saw the misery caused by too frequent pregnancies among the
					poor and resolved to help the mothers of <place reg="United States"
						>America</place> obtain safe, harmless birth control information. After ten
					days the clinic was raided by the police, Mrs. Sanger was convicted and spent a
					month in jail, but on appeal a judicial opinion was handed down permitting
					doctors to give contraceptive advice </q>
				<q who="CRAF"> "for the cure or prevention of disease." </q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Taking advantage of this decision, Mrs. Sanger opened the <org>Birth
						Control Clinical Research Bureau</org> in <place reg="New York, NY">New York
						City</place> in 1923. This clinic, the oldest in America and the largest in
					the world, has been operating ever since and serves as a teaching centre for
					clinics throughout the country. </q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">In the spring of 1929 this clinic, too, was raided but the protests of
					physicians, lawyers, and an outraged public made it quickly apparent that a
					mistake had been made. Mrs. Sanger received an official apology and the court
					decision fully exonerated the clinic physicians.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Meanwhile Mrs. Sanger was developing the national and international
					aspects of the subject. In 1921 she organized the <org
						reg="American Birth Control Conference, 1st">First American Birth Control
						Conference</org>, held in New York. The meeting was attended by men and
					women prominent in medicine and the social sciences and their participation and
					offers to help the cause did much to establish the movement.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">World Tour</head>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">The following year Mrs. Sanger made a world tour, speaking in <place
						reg="China">China</place>, <place reg="Japan">Japan</place>, and <place
						reg="Hawaii">Hawaii</place>. Great impetus was given to birth control in the
						<place reg="Asia">Orient</place>through this visit.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">An <org
						reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 6th"
						>International Birth Control Conference</org> was held in <place
						reg="New York, NY">New York</place> under her leadership in 1925, and two
					years later she was instrumental in calling together the <org
						reg="World Population Conference, 1927"> World Population Conference in
						Geneva</org>. </q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Resigning the presidency of the <org reg="American Birth Control League"
						> American Birth Control League</org>, which she had founded, Margaret
					Sanger organized the <org
						reg="National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control"> National
						Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org> in 1929,to secure
					the amendment of the federal laws which forbid the sending of contraceptive
					information or supplies by mail or common carrier. Realizing that these federal
					laws must be amended of birth control information is to be given by clinics and
					hospitals to the poor who need it most, the Committee was organized for a
					nation-wide educational campaign. Its membership includes leading
					public-spirited men and women--doctors, teachers, ministers, welfare workers,
					nurses, editors, economists, and home-makers. It comprises many thousands of
					individuals who have given their personal endorsement to the birth control
					movement and the legislative aims of the Committee. </q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Campaign to Amend Laws</head>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Actively aiding in the campaign to amend the federal laws is an imposing
					list of medical, social, educational, religious, and political organizations.
					The success of Mrs. Sanger’s work during the last five years may be measured in
					part by the number and kinds of groups which have passed resolutions in support
					of her efforts to amend the federal laws. Outstanding among these are the <org
						reg="Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America">Federal Council of
						Churches of Christ in America</org>, regional conferences of the <org
						reg="Methodist Episcopal Church">Methodist Episcopal Church</org>, the
					General Convention of the <org
						reg="General Convention of the House of Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church"
						>House of Bishops</org> and <org
						reg="General Convention of the House of Deputies of the Protestant Episcopal Church"
						>House of Deputies of the Protestant Episcopal Church</org>, state medical
					societies and state public health associations, state Conferences of Social
					Work, <org reg="League of Women Voters">Leagues of Women Voters</org>, <org
						reg="Parents and Teachers Association">Parents and Teachers
						Associations</org>, and, during the last year, the <org>General Federation
						of Women's Clubs</org> composed of 2,000,000 members and the <org>American
						Association of University Women</org>, representing 450,000 college women.
				</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Bills have been introduced into each <org reg="United States Congress"
						>Congress</org> since 1930 and hearings, with attendant publicity, have been
					held. </q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">A happy recognition of Mrs. Sanger’s services was given by the
						<org>American Women's Association</org> which in 1931 presented to her its
					medal for distinguished achievement. During this year her autobiography, "<title
						type="book">My Fight for Birth Control</title>," was published. Mrs. Sanger
					is also the author of "<title type="book">Motherhood in Bondage</title>,"
						"<title type="book">Happiness in Marriage</title>," "<title type="book"
						>Woman and the New Race</title>," "<title type="book">The Pivot of
						Civilization </title>." She founded the "<title type="journal">Birth Control
						Review</title>" and was its editor for eleven years.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="RG">Among her major activities during the least few years are the
					organization of the <org>American Conference on Birth Control and National
						Recovery</org>, held in <place reg="Washington, DC">Washington</place> in
					January, 1934, the introduction of bills now pending in Congress and the gradual
					enlightenment of the National Committee through regional and state chairmen.
