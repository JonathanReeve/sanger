			<p> “Control of the population is one of the great problems of life, and the greatest
				problem of our age,” <q who="BCE">she said</q>. “When we call into the world a new
				life consciously, then we begin on a new and better civilization.</p>
			<p> “Birth control is, however first of all, an answer to the prayer of the poor-- the
				sad, unfortunate people all over the world who are asking what they can do to keep
				from wrecking the lives of countless of mothers and keep fathers from becoming
				hopeless and despairing.”</p>

			<head type="sub"> Tells About <place>India</place></head>
			<q who="BCE">
				<p> She labeled it the country of contrasts, filled with the horribly rich and the
					poor to whom life is a starved, living death, where the weather is either
					intensely hot or icy cold; where persons are either abysmally ignorant or deeply
					learned. India, she said, has tried everything, and she pointed out that, in the
					face of “Purdah,” that state where women as a majority were kept in virtual
					imprisonment never being seen by any man except their husbands. <person
						reg="Gandhi, Mahatma">Gandhi</person> had but to send out the call and the
					women heroically revolted to free themselves almost overnight. </p>

			<p> “There were no legal objections in India in my work and absolutely no religious
				interference like that in this country,” <q who="BCE">she continued.</q> “Because in
				India, the problem has become acute and leaders and educators have been forced to
				this action.”</p>
		</div>

			<head type="sub"> Reason for Control</head>
			<p> “But the identical factors necessitating birth control exist in this country that
				exist in India. First, the infant mortality rate; second, the father’s wage; third,
				the need to space children to give mothers and children a chance; and fourth, the
				place of the child in the family. Certainly to regard to this last point it is
				apparent that it makes little difference if the mother has waited two and three
				years between each child, if there are too many children in the family. Figures from
				any health report show that. When there are seven children in a family, the
				mortality rate jumps drastically. When we get up to twelve children in the family,
				the records show that 60 per cent of the twelve die. </p>
			<p> “Who, then, benefits from this? Does the community? Does the nation? Does the church
				gain by the unhappy deaths of hundreds of mothers and hundreds of children? I
				maintain that we are in a state of barbarism when we have the knowledge that will
				make these tragic lives happy, that will save these suffering mothers, that will
				insure children a right place in their family picture-- and we withhold it. Why not
				make life something constructive. Why waste it?</p>
			<p> “We are trying to make a new world,” <q who="BCE">said Mrs. Sanger</q>, “to pass on
				the torch of life in bodies, fit, perfect and beautiful. We want young people to
				look on marriage not filled with fear, to have women exist without the sword of
				death hanging over their heads. We want to give to the poor the same knowledge those
				of wealth have. We want to amend the federal laws so that all hospitals can
				distribute information and that the information can be transmitted through the
				mails.” </p>
