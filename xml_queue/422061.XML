			<q who="DRC">Mrs. Margaret Sanger, founder of the Birth Control movement, has proposed
				that the <org reg="United States Government"> Federal government</org> provide for
				sterilization of the feeble-minded, and victims of transmissible, congenital
				disease. </q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="DRC"> Her message was read to the annual luncheon of the <org
					reg="Planned Parenthood
			Federation of America"> planned Parenthood Federation
					of America</org>, of which she is honorary chairman.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"While our present Federal Government Santa Clauses have their hands in the taxpayers'
			pockets," <q who="DRC"> she said,</q> "why not in their generous giving mood be
			constructive and provide for sterilizing as well as giving a pension, dole--call it what
			you may-- to the feeble-minded and the victims of transmissible, congenital
			diseases?"</p>
		<p>"Such a program would be a sound future investment as well as a kindness to the couples
			themselves by preventing the birth of dozens of their progeny to become burdens, even
			criminals of another generation. It would save innocent children from the cruelty of
			being born to such parents."</p>
