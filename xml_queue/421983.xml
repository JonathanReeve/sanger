		<p><q who="TDC">Mrs. Margaret Sanger, birth control advocate, challenged President
				Eisenhower last night to debate the question of governmental participation in
				planned parenthood for nations requesting help.</q></p>
		<p>"He needs to be straightened out on this," <q who="TDC">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> "It is
			disgraceful that our country does not respond when a poor, overpopulated country asks
			for aid."</p>
		<p><q who="TDC">She said that Eisenhower set back the birth control movement by his recent
				refusal to help overpopulated countries settle their problems by planned parenthood.
			</q></p>
		<p>"Such countries do not know what to do," <q who="TDC">she said.</q> "They want our health
			and welfare departments to show them what to do. If we are serious in wanting peace we
			should be glad to help them."</p>
		<p><q who="TDC">Eisenhower, she said, knows only war.</q></p>
		<p>"He doesn't realize that the question of war or peace is primarily a question of
			population," <q who="TDC">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> "He goes gallivanting off to various
			countries to talk peace. But he knows nothing about population problems in those
			countries--especially <place>India</place>."</p>
		<p><q who="TDC"><place>Japan</place>, she said, has reduced the birthrate 50 per cent since
				1957 by practicing planned parenthood.</q></p>
		<p>"The movement started here in 1920 and met great resistance by the warmongering
			politicians. But the Japanese people kept at it even though some of them were jailed for
			sponsoring birth control."</p>
		<p><q who="TDC">Does she believe the President will agree to a debate, or grant her an
				interview?</q></p>
		<p>"He certainly should," <q who="TDC">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> "He's an intelligent man, but
			he just doesn't know about this problem. He has been misinformed. He has been influenced
			by the opposition--by the Irish Catholic bishops."</p>
		<p><q who="TDC">She said that the Draper report, requested by Eisenhower, had indicated that
				we should assist on request those nations needing population control. But Eisenhower
				apparently has rejected the report, after initially accepting it, she said.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"If he will debate the question and learn something about this problem I am confident
			that he would change his views," <q who="TDC">Mrs. Sanger said.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"We cannot have peace without halting the population explosion which is currently
			occurring in various countries such as India."</p>
