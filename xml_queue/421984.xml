		<head>BIRTH CONTROL IN JAPAN</head>
		<p><emph rend="bold">To the Editors:</emph> In February I visited <place>Japan</place> on my
			way to <place>India</place>. I met with a number of women who wanted me to stay and help
			them. As I had not planned to do that I said that I would return. So after I had
			returned to <place reg="Tucson, AZ">Tucson</place> and settled up my affairs, especially
			with my doctors, I went off to Japan, taking four teen-agers, two of them my <person
				reg="Sanger, Nancy"><person reg="Marston, Margaret Sanger"
				>granddaughters</person></person>, and <person reg="Schneiderman, Barbara"><person
					reg="Chambers, Susan">their friends</person></person>. The girls lived in a
			Japanese home and traveled through Japan, always living in Japanese hotels, and have
			many Japanese songs that they sing very well.</p>
		<p>Japan's birth rate, which was cut down fifty per cent in 1958, is really a great
			encouragement to all of us. We must not forget, too, that while <person
				reg="MacArthur, Douglas">Douglas MacArthur</person> was in power, he allowed the
			Eugenics Protection Law to remain, and certainly did not encourage the people of Japan
			to abolish that law. The Japanese people love children, but as one woman said, <q
				who="UNK">"We do not love those that we do not know."</q></p>
		<p>They are doing all they can to encourage contraception and to reduce abortion, but, and
			it is a big "B" with "but," they have a problem, not as great as India's but still a
			problem nevertheless.</p>
