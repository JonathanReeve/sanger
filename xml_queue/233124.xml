		<p>It is good to come back like the spring to your beautiful country. It is going to be a
			renewed experience for me to be here in April, for it was that month in 1922 that I
			first came to <place>Japan</place>, and now I am here again with a very charming friend,
			half of your country, and half of mine, <person reg="Hata, Chieko">Mrs. Chieko
				Hata</person>, who was born in the <place>United States</place> of Japanese parents. </p>
		<p> The purpose of my trip is to get first hand information about the progress that has been
			made by the Japanese Minister of Welfare, Dr. <person reg="Hashimoto, Ryugo"
				>Koseisho</person>, and Dr. <person reg="Koya, Yoshio">Y. Koya</person>, Director of
			the <org reg="Japan Institute of Public Health">Institute of Public Health</org>. They
			are both in their various fields combining to the contribution of the welfare of the
			people of Japan in the program of mothers health by establishing first ranking positions
			in the world through family planning. Their method of imparting information to the
			mothers personally and privately is the first method of this kind anywhere to be given,
			and I am very anxious to consult with them both as to results. </p>
		<p> Also the <org>Family Planning Federation of Japan</org> has been organized, and its
			first National meeting is to be held April 18th. I am happy to be there in person to
			congratulate them and to see for myself and to hear from the field workers of family
			planning as to their successful results. </p>
		<p> It is my pleasure to be in Japan in April, and I trust that the cherry
			trees will still be in bloom. My first visit to Japan was in April, 1922, an experience
			that I have never forgotten. </p>
