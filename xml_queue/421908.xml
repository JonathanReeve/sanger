		<head>BIRTH CONTROL SEEN AS BENEFIT TO NATION</head>
		<byline>By <person reg="Hutchison, John">John
			Hutchison</person></byline>
		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="MCA">Birth control is the logical, fundamental treatment
					for the ills of slums, crime, illiteracy and child labor,
					Mrs. Margaret Sanger, internationally famous lecturer, told
					the audience at the Fairgrounds Casino. </q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="MCA">A crowd estimated at 900, preponderantly feminine,
					heard her call on government to attack what she called the
					root of those evils--too many children in families unable to
					support them and educate them.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“We are spending billions annually because of slums, crime and
				truancy,” <q who="MCA"> she said,</q> “But we are not attacking
				the fundamental problem. Crime alone costs every person in the
					<place>United States</place> $125 a year.” <q who="MCA">Most
					of the criminals come from “blighted areas” where parents
					are unable to limit their families to a size they can care
					for, she declared.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Knowledge Should Be Spread </head>

			<p>
				<q who="MCA"> Dissemination of birth control knowledge by public
					health agencies, reaching poor families, is a necessary
					governmental function, she said. Normal persons whose
					offspring would be a valuable asset to the <place
						reg="United States">Nation</place> are unable to rear
					families because they must bear the burden of sustaining
					millions of poor, feeble-minded and unfit children of
					parents who should practice birth control, she asserted.</q>
			</p>

			<p> “The normal family cannot rear children because it must pay for
				this vast army by taxation,” <q who="MCA">she said.</q> “If
				mothers were not enslaved by child-bearing and fathers were not
				burdened with supporting large families, the general level of
				intellect would rise, taking a burden off the entire group.”</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Definition Given </head>

			<p>
				<q who="MCA">Mrs. Sanger’s address opened with a definition of
					birth control as the conscious control of the birth rate by
					prevention of, not interference with, conception. She said
					there was no intent to interfere with or destroy life. </q>
			</p>
			<p>“When anyone says birth control is murder he shows colossal
				ignorance of biology,” <q who="MCA">she said.</q> “Birth control
				does not allow life to begin. There is no moral difference
				between birth control and continence in that respect.”</p>

			<p>
				<q who="MCA">Everywhere today there is control, she pointed out,
					in traffic, currency, agriculture. Man differs from the
					animal in that he is conscious of actions and consequences
					and man will begin a new civilization when he learns to
					apply that consciousness to reproduction. </q>
			</p>

		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Reasons Outlined</head>

			<p><q who="MCA">The slight, red-haired woman who has given 25 years
					of her life to her cause, outlined seven reasons for
					contraception: <list>
						<item>1. The man or woman capable of transmitting a
							mental disease must practice birth control or be
							sterilized. She said if she were dictator she would
							offer an old-age pension to any mentally unfit
							person who would submit to sterilization. </item>
						<item> 2. A temporary disease in a woman may be so
							disturbed by child birth that pregnancy causes her
							death. </item>
						<item> 3. Normal parents sometimes give birth to
							abnormal children.</item>
						<item> 4. Every woman should have the right to “space”
							her babies three or four years apart, for her own
							health and that of children. </item>
						<item> 5. Although early marriage is desirable, children
							should be postponed by young parents until the
							parents have outgrown adolescence. </item>
						<item> 6. Parents shouldn’t have children they can’t
							support. They shouldn’t have children who will have
							no other field of employment but the unskilled work,
							now overcrowded. </item>
						<item> 7. Proper regulation of family size will raise
							the intellectual level of the Nation, because in the
							small family there is opportunity for parents to
							train their children, and to have time to improve
							themselves.</item>
					</list></q></p>

			<head>Memphians Speak</head>
			<p><q who="MCA">Mrs. Sanger was introduced by Dr. <person
						reg="Pride, William T.">W. T. Pride</person>, who said
					he hoped the time is not far off when contraceptives will be
					afforded only through medical prescription, insuring proper
					methods. Also on the platform were Dr. <person
						reg="Loaring-Clark, Alfred">Alfred
						Loaring-Clark</person> of <org>St. John's Episcopal
						Church</org> and Dr. <person reg="Sibley, Josiah">Josiah
						Sibley</person>, pastor of <org>Lindsay Memorial
						Presbyterian Church</org>.</q></p>
			<p><q who="MCA">"</q><q who="LOAAL">People must be dragged into new
					eras of thought</q>," Dr. Loaring-Clark said. "<q
					who="LOAAL">How stupid to shudder at the thoguht of
					contraception.</q>" Dr. Sibley said he was convinced that
				the "<q who="SIBJO">truth of birth control is good for
					humanity."</q></p>
			<p><q who="MCA">Mrs. Sanger will address a negro audience at 8:30
					o'clock tonight at the <org>Metropolitan Baptist
						Church</org>. She will return to her <place
						reg="New York, NY">New York</place> home tomorrow. Her
					lecture was sponsored by the Birth Control Committee in
					Memphis.</q></p>
