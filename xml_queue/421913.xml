			<head><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">MARGARET SANGER</person>, AWARD WINNER, HERE; PLANS
				BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC</head>
		
		<div>
			<p>Resting briefly after the most decisive battle in a career which has been unceasing
				war waged on a front which ranged from crowded tenement districts to <org
					reg="United States Senate">U.S. senate</org> committee rooms, Margaret Sanger,
				noted birth control crusader, is a visit in the <place reg="Phoenix, Arizona">Salt
					River valley</place>.</p>
			<p>With her husband, <person reg="Slee, James Noah H.">J. Noah N. Slee</person>, retired
				president of the <org reg="3-in-1 Oil Company">3-in-1 Oil Company</org>, who has
				been vacationing in the valley for some time, she is a guest at Hotel San Marcos in
				Chandler and will remain in <place>Arizona</place> for several weeks.</p>
			<p>Shortly before leaving her <place reg="Fishkill, New York">Fishkill, N.Y.</place>home
				for Arizona, she was honored at a dinner by the <org
					reg="Town Hall, New York, New York">Town Hall Club of Manhattan</org>, composed
				of social elite of the East, and was presentred with the club's award of honor for
				the year's most conspicuous contribution to the enlargement and enrichment of life.
				The award was made January 15.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub">Court Rules Favorably</head>
		
			<p>From prison to palace Mrs. Sanger since 1914 has carried her crusade to permit the
				dissemination of scientific information which would enable parents to limit their
				families to a number for which they can care properly. On December 7, the <org
					reg="United States Circuit Court of Appeals">U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</org>
				removed the greatest obstacle in the way of success of the crusade when it ruled
				that physicians might send contraceptives by mail. This decision nullified a
				63-year-old law which made sending such material by mail or common carrier a crime
				punishable by $5,000 fine and five years in prison. The court ruling also gives
				physicians the right to advise their patients when they deem it necessary for their
				general health and well-being.</p>
			<p>A measure embodying much the same idea introduced into the last session of congress
				with the support of the <org reg="General Federation of Women's Clubs">General
					Federation of Women's Clubs</org>, the <org
					reg="National Federation of Business and Women's Professional Clubs">National
					Federation of Business and Professional Clubs</org>, <org
					reg="the Young Women's Christian Association">the Young Women's Christian
					Association</org> and other large groups, died in <org
					reg="Senate Judiciary Committee">the senate judiciary committee</org>, of which
					<person reg="Ashurst, Henry Fountain">Sen. Henry F. Ashurst</person>of Arizona
				is chairman.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub">Crusader Still Active</head>
		
			<p>Elated over the victory which the court ruling gave the cause to which she has
				devoted much of her life, Mrs. Sanger has no thought of ceasing her efforts. Rather,
				two weeks after the verdict she celebrated with a birth control conference in <place
					reg="New York, New York">Manhattan</place>, and during her stay here she plans
				the establishment of a birth control clinic in <place reg="Phoenix, Arizona"
					>Phoenix</place>. Such a clinic would be operated along the same lines as the
				one opened in Tucson last June.</p>
			<p>Improvement of the race through the limitation of families to a number for which the
				parents can provide proper physical, mental and spiritual support and lessening of
				the tax burden through reducing the number of indigents to be provided for from
				public funds are two important results which Mrs. Sanger expects from wide-spreadh
				birth control. She believes it also will reduce that some authorities refer to as
				the abortion “racket.”</p>
			<p>“Add to that- call it sentimentality if you will- the happiness of the man and woman
				who, loving each other enough to marry, find themselves bound to the wheel in order
				to provide even the bare necessities for an ever-increasing brood. The mother, her
				strength sapped by constant child-bearing and attempts to care for her children, and
				the father, tired and careworn with the economic battle, have no times for that real
				companionship which is a right of marriage.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<head type="sub"> Holds Happiness Important</head>
			<p>“Human happiness IS important. It must be, else our forefathers who wrote the
				constitution would not have included ‘pursuit of happiness’ among the inalienable
				rights. “Society at large is adversely affected by addition to it of children for
				whom there is no chance of proper development. Families so large that the parents
				cannot care for them become the burden of the taxpayer who must provide funds for
				their care. Crime, too, breeds in the crowded districts, and again the taxpayers and
				citizens at large are the losers.” </p>
			<p>More than 320 clinics have been established in the United States through the efforts
				of the dynamic little crusader, and her work has not stopped on this side of the
					<place reg="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</place>. Last year she spread her gospel in
					<place>India</place>, <place>Switzerland</place>, <place reg="Soviet Union"
					>Russia</place>, <place>Canada</place> and <place>England</place> all know of
				Margaret Sanger.</p>
			<p>Foreign nations-with the exception of <place>Italy</place>and
				<place>Germany</place>and other military nations “where men are only cannon fodder
				and women sources of war material” - are friendly toward the birth control movement,
				Mrs. Sanger said. In England clinics are established under the jurisdiction of the
				government and doctors must provide the information. Other nations have similar
				setups.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head>Compliments Phoenician</head>
		
			<p> “One trouble in the United States has been,” Mrs. Sanger said, “that physicians
				themselves do not all know proper contraceptive methods. Medical schools have not
				trained students in contraception. Even now only five schools so train their embryo
				physicians.”</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger paid high tribute to <person reg="Struckmeyer, Fritzi">Fritzi
					Struckmeyer</person> as the first woman in any state legislature or in congress
				to "have the courage to introduce legislation which would remove obstacles to the
				movement which means so much to their own se." Last week, Miss Struckmeyer, serving
				her first term as a member of the <org reg="13th Arizona State Legislature">13th
					legislature</org>, introduced such a bill.</p>
			<p>Asked concerning activity of women in office in support of the movement, Mrs. Sanger
				expressed disappointment, saying it has been phraseology only with little actual
				support. To woman’s newness in official positions she attributes this attitude,
				believing that in many instances they have not gained the poise necessary to
				publicly espouse a movement which might prove unpopular.</p>
			<p>She does believe ardently that women's influence in legislative matters is making
				itself felt, to the benefit of the nation. Women on juries have been an active
				influence toward lceaning up the courts and influencing justice, she believes.,
				expressing surprise at Arizona's continued attitude of banning women from jury
				service.</p>
			<p>The fact that Arizona has the highest maternal and infant mortality rate of any state
				in the union except <place reg="New Mexico">New Mexico</place>she characterized as
				"ridiculous - and unnessary."</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub">Gracious Personality</head>
		
			<p>Looking back over Margaret Sanger's career and realizing that it has carried her into
				court many times, put her in prison and placed her before senate committees, it
				would be, for one who has not met her easy to imagine her the "Amazon type" woman.
				Nothing could be farther from a true description.</p>
			<p>Gracious, vital, there is about her a sweetness which inspires belief in her
				sincerity when in answer to the question, “But how is it with you? Truly the fight
				is well on the way to being won-- but at what a personal sacrifice to you! Has it
				been worth it, personally?”, she answered, “A hundred fold. I feel that instead of
				being given the award of honor I should have given it. There is a great sense of
				peace in fulfilling one’s destiny.” </p>
			<p>The red of her hair has been subdued somewhat by a generous sprinkling of gray - for
					<person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Higgins</person> was born in 1883 - but
				there is no lessening of the fire with which she champions her cause. Her sparkling
				wit and quick perception, a heritage from Irish-born parents, highlight a magnetic
				personality.</p>
			<p>She is the mother of two sons, one of whom is a practicing physician and the other
				studying to become a doctor. Her only daughter she lost through death.</p>
