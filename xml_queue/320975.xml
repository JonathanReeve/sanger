		<head>Birth Control.</head>
		<p>The <org>Planned Parenthood Federation of America</org>, Inc., formerly the <org>Birth
				Control Federation of America</org>, Inc. made marked advances in 1943,
			concentrating on five programs of activity.</p>
		<div>
			<head rend="sub">Public Health.--</head>
			<p>Five more states initiated cooperative efforts with the federation to include
				pregnancy spacing in their public health services--bringing the total number of
				states to eleven. The federation became a member of the <org>National Health
					Council</org>.</p>
			<p><emph rend="italics">Clinical Service.</emph> --On Dec. 1, 1943 birth control
				services totalled 786; 211 in hospitals; 286 in public health quarters; 288
				extra-mural; 372 of total supported in whole or part by public funds. Services for
				treatment of sterility were listed in the federation’s Clinic Directory.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head rend="sub">Industrial Hygiene.--</head>
			<p>Absenteeism, due often to pregnancy or induced abortion, became an acute problem in
				many areas, as millions of women went into war work. the division of industrial
				hygiene, <org reg="United States Public Health Service">U.S.P.H. service</org>,
				recommended, in an outline for use in industry, that “<q who="USPHS">advice on the
					proper spacing of children, as a means of protecting the health of the mother
					and her children</q>”, be given married women workers, by counsellors in plants.
				Dr. <person reg="Dodge, Eva">Eva Dodge</person>, the federation’s assistant medical
				director, surveyed a number of plants, and, in co-operation with the
					<place>Alabama</place> state health department, assisted in preparing two
				pamphlets on this problem, for use by workers and management. A radio transcription,
					“<title type="article">Freedom From Fear</title>”, dealing with the problem of
				absenteeism, due to pregnancy, was produced by the federation for use of its state
				leagues.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head rend="sub">Education.</head>
			<p><emph rend="italics">Medical.</emph>Over 11,000 copies of Dr. <person
					reg="Dickinson, Robert Latou">Robert L. Dickinson</person>’s pamphlet, “<title
					type="book">Techniques of Conception Control</title>”, were sent on request to
				physicians, bringing the total to 56,000 issued on request to this group, and 17,000
				were sent to registered nurses on request.</p>
			<p>Birth control training institutes for public health nurses were held in
					<place>Florida</place>, <place>Delaware</place> and <place>North
					Carolina</place>.</p>
			<p><emph rend="italics">Research.</emph>--Although no new discoveries were made during
				the year, a special committee of the council on pharmacy and chemistry of the
					<org>American Medical Association</org> continued research in chemical
				contraceptives, and the council on physical therapy initiated a co-operative program
				dealing with mechanical articles and devices. Reports appear in the <title
					type="journal">Journal of the American Medical Assn.</title> for Dec. 18,
				1943.</p>
			<p><emph rend="italics">Social Work.</emph> -- A new pamphlet, “<title type="book">The
					Case Worker and Family Planning</title>”, was sent upon request to 2,000 social
				workers. The federation participated, as a kindred group, in the <org>National
					Conference of Social Work</org>. A newly formed advisory committee directed work
				in this field.</p>
			<p><emph rend="italics">Negro Program.</emph> -- The <org
					reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Division of Negro Service"
					>division of Negro Service</org>, with its advisory council of 46, and
				sponsoring committee of 146 members, representing national professional, medical,
				religious and civic leadership, was strengthened, and a pamphlet, “<title
					type="book">Better Health for 13,000,000</title>" published, reporting on the
				program of family planning for Negroes.</p>
			<p><emph rend="italics">Religious.</emph> -- The <org
					reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America, National Clergyman's Advisory Council"
					>National Clergymen’s Advisory council</org> was organized with almost 1000
				members from 46 states. Organization of the council, and election of officers was
				undertaken, and a pamphlet on “<title type="book">Marriage Counsel</title>”, for use
				of the clergy published.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head rend="sub">Teaching in Medical Schools.</head>
			<p>-- To stimulate better teaching of contraception in medical schools, Dr. <person
					reg="Brown, W. E.">W. E. Brown</person> of <org>Cincinnati Medical School</org>,
				visited 26 grade A colleges, for the federation, finding some teaching of the
				subject in each. His teaching Syllabus was distributed to grade A schools throughout
				the <place reg="United States">U.S.</place>, 45% of which were giving some
				instruction in 1943.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head rend="sub">State Organizations.</head>
			<p>--In 9 affiliated states, <place>Maryland</place>, Delaware, West Virginia,
					<place>Virginia</place>, <place>Florida</place>, <place>Iowa</place>,
					<place>Minnesota</place>, <place>Tennessee</place> and <place>Missouri</place>,
				programs were broadened and strengthened by addition of professional staff members
				and executives. One more state, <place>Ohio</place>, became affiliated, bringing the
				total to 34.</p>
			<p><emph rend="italics">Legal.</emph> -- The <org reg="United States Supreme Court">U.S.
					Supreme Court</org> refused the <name type="case" reg="Tileston v. Ullman"
					>Tileston</name> case involving the right of <place>Connecticut</place> doctors
				to advise contraceptives where life or health were threatened.</p>
			<p><emph rend="italics"><place>Massachusetts</place> Referendum.</emph> -- Although over
				half a million votes were cast in its favour, the referendum to amend the state law
				so that doctors might legally advise patients on contraception failed of
				passage.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub">International.</head>
			<p> -- The war made organized work in occupied <place>Europe</place> impossible. In
					<place>Great Britain</place> educational work, clinical service and research
				were continued by the <org>Family Planning Association</org>. In
					<place>Australia</place> the law passed in 1942 did not interfere with clinical
				work. Health boards in <place>Bermuda</place> planned wider dissemination of birth
				control information, to cope with the problem of overpopulation there.</p>
			<p>Birth rates fell in most of Europe but were higher than in years in Great Britain. In
				the United States they were higher than for 20 years past. (See also Birth
				Statistics)</p>
