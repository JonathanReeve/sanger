		<head><emph rend="underline">Says Planned Parenthood Pioneer</emph>: U.S. Birth Rate Now
			Exceeds India's</head>
		<byline>By Eve Edstrom</byline>

		<p>
			<q who="WP">Margaret Sanger yesterday declared supporters of the birth control program
				are bringing it back to the people for whom it was intended-the low income
				families.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="WP">And <place reg="Washington, DC">Washington,</place> she said, is pioneering
				in helping low-income parents to learn how families can be limited.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="WP">Still battling for her cause at age 73, the founder of the American birth
				control movement is in town to help Washington's Planned Parenthood Association
				celebrate its 21st birthday.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="WP">A "coming of age" party in honor of the event is scheduled this evening at
				the home of Mr. and Mrs. <person reg="Myers, George Hewitt">George Hewitt
					Myers,</person> 2310 S st. nw. Mrs. Myers worked staunchly with Mrs. Sanger
				during the several legal fights to permit dissemination of birth control
				information.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="WP">Washington's Planned Parenthood group currently is sending a social worker
				into low-income housing developments to acquaint families with its program and to
				refer them for medical advice.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"The program never was intended for middle-class families who could afford to go to
			doctors, who were not so tied down with children that they were prevented from getting
			to clinics," <q who="WP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q></p>
		<p>"It was intended for low-income families but it must be brought to them. The success of
			the Washington program in getting information to those who need it has caused <place
				reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago,</place>
			<place reg="Kansas City, MO">Kansas City</place> and <place reg="Dallas, TX"
				>Dallas</place> to adopt the same approach."</p>

		<p><q who="WP">Mrs. Sanger began crusading for birth control in 1914 after having nursed a
				young woman who later died in childbirth. She vowed then to go to the root of the
				trouble</q> "so women could have babies only when their health and purses
			permitted."</p>

		<p><q who="WP">At that time, she said, the campaign had dramatic appeal because many persons
				were aroused over the </q>"wretched effects" <q who="WP">that lack of family
				planning had on mothers' health.</q>
		</p>

		<p>
			<q who="WP">With the improvement in maternal health and child welfare in this country,
				she continued, the need to battle for birth control is not so glaringly
				apparent.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q who="WP">But</q> "to people who care about what their own children and grandchildren
			are going to face," <q who="WP">Mrs. Sanger said it is</q> "alarming" <q who="WP">that
				this <place reg="United States">Nation</place> is so far behind other countries in
				birth control programs.</q></p>

		<p>
			<q who="WP">Emphasizing that our birth rate now is higher than <place>India</place>'s,
				Mrs. Sanger noted that India, <place>Japan</place>, and a number of other countries
				are financing programs to bring birth control information to their people.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q who="WP">Our failure to act similarly, she said, comes because</q> "we don't have fun
			with ideas any more, everything is pleasant, we have nice conversations and don't battle
			with the opposition."</p>

		<p>
			<q who="WP">Regarding the recent local battle of the Planned Parenthood Association to
				be admitted to <org>United Community Services</org> for financial support, Mrs.
				Sanger said she was against Planned Parenthood chapters becoming Chest members
				because they become weak and ineffective.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q who="WP">Just back from <place reg="Honolulu, HI">Honolulu</place> and off to <place
					reg="London, England">London</place> soon, Mrs. Sanger is not expected to ever
				stop fighting for her cause-but her fight cannot be interpreted as one against large
				families. With a wide smile, she states that <person reg="Sanger, Grant">one of her
					two doctor sons</person> has six children but, she adds,</q> "they were
			planned-or so they tell me."</p>
