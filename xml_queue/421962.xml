		<head>U.S. Birth Rate Now Exceeds India's</head>
		<byline>By <person reg="Edstrom, Eve">Eve Edstrom</person></byline>
		<q id="WP">
			<p><person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> yesterday declared supporters
				of the birth control program are bringing it back to the people for whom it was
				intended-the low income families.</p>
			<p>And <place reg="Washington, D.C.">Washington,</place> she said, is pioneering in
				helping low-income parents to learn how families can be limited.</p>
			<p>Still battling for her cause at age 73, the founder of the <org
					reg="National Birth Control League">American birth control movement</org> is in
				town to help <org>Washington's Planned Parenthood Association</org> celebrate its
				21st birthday.</p>
		</q>
		<p>A <q who="UNK">"coming of age"</q>
			<q who="WP"> party in honor of the event is scheduled this evening at the home of
					<person reg="Myers, George Hewitt, Mr. and Mrs.">Mr. and Mrs. George Hewitt
					Myers,</person> 2310 S st. nw. Mrs. Myers worked staunchly with Mrs. Sanger
				during the several legal fights to permit dissemination of birth control
				information.</q></p>
		<q who="WP">
			<p>Washington's Planned Parenthood group currently is sending a social worker into
				low-income housing developments to acquaint families with its program and to refer
				them for medical advice.</p>
		</q>
		<p>"The program never was intended for middle-class families who could afford to go to
			doctors, who were not so tied down with children that they were prevented from getting
			to clinics," Mrs. Sanger said.</p>
		<p>"It was intended for low-income families but it must be brought to them. The success of
			the Washington program in getting information to those who need it has caused <place
				reg="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago,</place>
			<place reg="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</place> and <place reg="Dallas, Texas"
				>Dallas</place> to adopt the same approach."</p>
		<q who="WP">
			<p>Mrs. Sanger began crusading for birth control in 1914 after having nursed a young
				woman who later died in childbirth. She vowed then to go to the root of the
				trouble</p>
		</q>
		<p>"so women could have babies only when their health and purses permitted."</p>
		<q who="WP">
			<p>At that time, she said, the campaign had dramatic appeal because many persons were
				aroused over the</p>
		</q>
		<q who="UNK">"wretched effects</q>
		<p>
			<q who="WP">that lack of family planning had on mothers' health.</q>
		</p>
		<q who="WP">
			<p>With the improvement in maternal health and child welfare in this country, she
				continued, the need to battle for birth control is not so glaringly apparent.</p>
			<p>But</p>
		</q>
		<p>"to people who care about what their own children and grandchildren are going to face,"
				<q who="WP">Mrs. Sanger said it is</q> "alarming" <q who="WP">that this <place
					reg="United States">Nation</place> is so far behind other countries in birth
				control programs.</q></p>
		<q who="WP">
			<p>Emphasizing that our birth rate now is higher than <place>India's,</place> Mrs.
				Sanger noted that India, <place>Japan,</place> and a number of other countries are
				financing programs to bring birth control information to their people.</p>
			<p>Our failure to act similarly, she said, comes because</p>
		</q>
		<p>"we don't have fun with ideas any more, everything is pleasant, we have nice
			conversations and don't battle with the opposition."</p>
		<q who="WP">
			<p>Regarding the recent local battle of the Planned Parenthood Association to be
				admitted to <org>United Community Services</org> for financial support, Mrs. Sanger
				said she was against Planned Parenthood chapters becoming Chest members because they
				become weak and ineffective.</p>
			<p>Just back from <place reg="Honolulu, Hawaii">Honolulu</place> and off to <place
					reg="London, England">London</place> soon, Mrs. Sanger is not expected to ever
				stop fighting for her cause-but her fight cannot be interpreted as one against large
				families. With a wide smile, she states that one of her two doctor sons has six
				children but, she adds,</p>
		</q>
		<p>"they were planned-or so they tell me."</p>
