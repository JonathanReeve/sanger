		<div type="section">

				<q who="MCA">Mrs. Margaret Sanger, nationally known birth control authority who has
					been here a week for a series of lectures, left Memphis last night, equipped
					with at least three convictions: </q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="MCA">
					<list>
						<item>1. Memphis’ public health work is being carried on efficiently and
							advantageously.</item>
					</list>
				</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Clinic Is Progressing</head>
			<p>
				<q who="MCA">
					<list>
						<item>2. The birth control clinic set up and sponsored by the <org>Memphis
								Birth Control Committee</org> is progressing, doing excellent work
							in advising and aiding the many needy (and mostly young) mothers.</item>
						<item>3. Work of this clinic should be incorporated into activities of the
							public health clinic at <org>John Gaston Hospital</org>because it was
							established only as a proving ground to show the real need of a similar
							public clinic. The favor with which she was generally received in
							Memphis is indicative of success in this aim, although not necessarily
							in the near future.</item>
					</list>
				</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="MCA">Mrs. Sanger spoke to numerous groups, some physicians and nurses only,
					some for the public at large. But on each occasion, Mrs. Sanger stressed last
					night before boarding her train for New York, she was cordially and very
					favorably received.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Definite Gains Seen</head>
			<p>“I was particularly impressed with the reception I had with every medical group. The
				best people of every community throughout my first trip to <place>Tennessee</place>
				were always present. No, I don’t expect any new idea to leap into execution, but we
				are definitely making progress. This is evidenced by the fact that while in
				Tennessee I spoke before 16 meetings. In Memphis alone my audiences totaled at least
				2500.” </p>
			<p>
				<q who="MCA">Mrs. Sanger was guest of honor last night at the home of <person
						reg="Long, Elizabeth B.">Mrs. Jerome P. Long</person>of 1513 Linden.
					Returning to New York with her were <person reg="Blodgett, Marguerite Barstow">Mrs.
						Stephen Blodgett</person>, also of <place reg="New York, NY">New
						York</place>, and Mrs. Long. She will go to <place reg="Tucson, AZ">Tucson,
						Ariz.</place>, soon.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“This morning I visited our clinic,” <q who="MCA">she said.</q> “There I saw three
				young mother, typical of the thousands we instruct yearly. One of them was the
				mother of nine children, with another coming along. She was the oldest. The other
				two, however, were girls in their 20s, both the mother of two or three. This is the
				type and age that need our help most.” </p>
