		<p> “To you in <place>India</place> who have given to the world marvelous temples that have
			been built by your great men in the past and handed on to use (westerners) to admire-
			and we do admire them- the time is now come to make another kind of temple, the ‘human
			temple’ and the ‘human body.’ Let us begin to make our bodies fit and perfect
			instruments to house that soul that we may summon to take its place in the mystery of
			human beings.”</p>

		<q who="HINDU">
			<p> Mrs. Margaret Sanger said that birth control was the key-not of a new moral and
				spiritual awakening. It was not only a health or economic expedient. It was a moral
				and social principle. That principle was interlocked with the spiritual advancement
				of nations and with the race as well. </p>
		</q>
		<q who="HINDU">
			<p> Many British Bishops and clergymen, Mrs. Sanger said, had been pleading for some
				time past that the members of the Christian faith should come forth and lead the
				movement so that it might be a constructive force in civilization and not to close
				their eyes and ears to its human appeal. </p>
