			<head type="sub"> Statement of Mrs. Margaret Sanger</head>
			<p> Mrs. Sanger. Mr. <person reg="Norris, George William">Chairman</person>, and
				gentlemen of the committee, the essential object of the <org
					reg="National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control">committee on
					Federal legislation for birth control</org> in supporting this bill, Senate 4582
				is to amend the existing Federal laws which prevent the dissemination through the
				mails of information relating to the subject of contraception. We want to make it
				possible for mothers have safe, scientific information to prevent conception so that
				they may regulate the size of their families, so that they may space out the number
				of children in the family in consideration of the mother’s health, of the father’s
				earning capacity, and the welfare of each child. </p>
			<p> I want to say, Mr. Chairman, that this is the first time that this bill, this
				particular kind of bill, has been introduced in the <org reg="United States Senate"
					>Senate</org>. It has been introduced by Senator <person
					reg="Gillett, Frederick Huntington">Gillett</person>, the chairman of this
				committee, and it may be referred to by the speakers following as the “doctor’s
				bill,” or the “birth control bill.” I want to say that the reason it has been
				referred to as the doctor’s bill is to distinguish it from other pieces of
				legislation on the same general subject, especially one bill that was introduced in
					<org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> in 1925, and known as the “open
				bill.” That bill aimed to take the whole subject of the prevention of conception out
				of the law, while this bill only asks that exceptions shall be made in this law, or
				in these laws, for physicians and for the regular practice of the medical
				profession. </p>
			<p> We not only want motherhood to be a conscious and controlled function but we want
				parenthood to be something other than the consequences of a reckless, careless
				shiftlessness. We want parenthood to be regarded as a fine commission, a noble
				trust, a splendid assignment, and it can be so considered only when it becomes a
				conscious responsibility. </p>
			<p> In the laws, which this bill, Senate 4582. will amend, contraceptive information has
				been classified with obscenity, pornography, and abortion. Information concerning
				contraception does not belong there. </p>
			<p>
				<name reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Section 211 of the criminal
					code</name> was passed by Congress in 1873 and at that time very little was
				known of the technique of contraception. Gradually knowledge of its importance has
				grown. The need for better information, for more scientific data on this important
				subject has been recognized. And there has gradually arisen in this country a
				movement in favor of birth control. We find to-day that parents consider birth
				control information not only a health measure, not alone an economic expedient, but
				a principle of social welfare by which the future advancement of the individual and
				the country itself is safeguarded. </p>
			<p> These laws which we are trying to amend have made no exception in their prohibitions
				for literature of a scientific character. Nor have they made an exception for the
				physician in his regular practice, or for hospitals or clinics, or for patients of
				these hospitals or clinics, or for the general and proper distribution of medical
				supplies. These laws have been the means of suppressing properly authorized
				scientific literature on the subject of contraception because no publisher will
				jeopardize his freedom or risk his reputation in publishing books when there is a
				law against their circulation. </p>
			<p> These laws interfere with the importation of articles, and of the results of
				research which is undertaken in other countries. Such data and such results of
				laboratory research would be of great assistance to the medical profession of his
				country in the proper functioning of their profession. </p>
			<p> These Federal laws interfere with the proper dissemination of information to prevent
				conception in 47 States of <place reg="United States">this Union</place> although
				there are already laws in those States enabling physicians to give advice to
				patients in their regular practice, and there are in this country to-day over 50
				legally operating birth control clinics distributed over 12 states. These birth
				control clinics are medically established and medically directed, and have been
				organized solely for the purpose of giving contraceptive information by the medical
				profession. </p>
			<p> I should like, Mr. Chairman, if I may, to present for the record the names of the
				clinics, and their locations. </p>

			<p>
				<supplied resp="MSS">The list, which was appended to the end of the days testimony,
					was omitted by the MSPP editors.</supplied>
			</p>

			<p> And, also a summary of the laws of the various States concerning the subject. </p>
			<p> The bill that we are advocating asks that the Federal laws which it would amend
				shall not apply to any licensed physician or hospital or clinic when the desired
				information has been published in the agency, medical society, medical school, or
				medical journal, nor shall it apply to reprints after such publication. This bill
				also asks that the name and address of any physician, hospital, or clinic where such
				birth-control advice is legally given may be sent through the mails. Under the laws
				now, especially section 211 of the Criminal Code, it is a crime for me or for anyone
				to send to a mother, a sister, or relative situated in any of these States the
				address of any clinic lawfully operating in that State, even though such an
				individual may be poverty stricken or diseased, even though she may have a right
				under that State law to have this information for her health and for her family
				happiness. The Federal law makes it a crime for anyone to send through the <org
					reg="United States Postal Service">United States mail</org> the address of a
				physician or a clinic where such information may be obtained. This bill asks that
				there be an exception in these cases. </p>
			<p> Mr. Chairman, we believe that this bill as presented is constructive, logical, and
				conservative. There is nothing in this bill which makes it mandatory or compels
				anyone to use this knowledge of contraception. There is nothing in this bill which
				makes any physician read such or which makes anyone apply for such literature, but
				we do ask for the thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of mothers who in many
				cases are inarticulate to ask this for themselves; we ask that these mothers have
				the right to go to their physician, to apply to their hospitals or clinics, and get
				proper scientific information suitable for their individual requirements. </p>
			<p> We want no wholesale distribution of indecency or pornography or obscenity. This
				bill, which we are advocating to-day, as it is presented, leaves the law exactly as
				it was, except that we remove the subject of the prevention of conception from the
				clause relating to indecency, obscenity, and pornography, and place it in the hands
				of the medical profession, where it rightfully belongs. </p>
			<p> Most of us believe that the original object of these laws was to prevent the
				dissemination of pornographic literature through the United States mails and to
				restrict its entrance into this country. We fully concur in the prevention of the
				distribution of pornographic or obscene literature. We believe, however, that is it
				unfair to classify medical and scientific information or literature in this class
				and to do so places a great hardship upon the general practice of the medical
				progression and upon our welfare agencies. The effect of keeping these laws on our
				statute books is to increase the surreptitious circulation of unscientific or
				harmful information which tends to increase crime and to multiply abortions. </p>
			<p> The laws, in effect, have already been responsible for a great deal of harm, and I
				think if we could measure the injury that has been done to women, and were aware of
				their damaged conditions, physiologically and mentally, the harm far outweighs the
				good that these laws have accomplished. </p>
			<p> It is roughly estimated that since this law was established in 1873 over 1,500,000
				mothers have passed out into the great beyond from causes due to child bearing, and
				we know today that the subject of contraception is intimately associated with the
				deaths of mothers and affects our maternal mortality. </p>
			<p> It is also roughly estimated that, since that law was passed, over 15,000,000
				children have passed out of life during their first year of infancy, many of them
				were children born in conditions of poverty and their mothers’ ill health. A great
				majority of them may have been living to-day had their mothers had a chance to
				recuperate from the ordeal of previous pregnancy instead of using up the vitality of
				the child before it was born. </p>
			<p> We, Mr. Chairman, believe that the effect of keeping these laws on the statute book
				is to keep alive hypocrisy, evasion, and a general increasing disregard for laws. We
				believe that there is nothing to be gained by keeping such laws on the statute books
				when they are known to be inimical to the personal health of mothers, to the family
				happiness, and to the general welfare and progress of the Nation. </p>
			<p> Mr. Chairman, may I also present some of the protests of the medical profession,
				medical associations, and other organizations against such laws?</p>
			<p> Mrs. Sanger: I would like to make a few remarks. There has been misrepresentation
				expressed here his morning based upon a certain undated circular, sent broadcast to
				various organizations, within the past week or two by an organization represented
				here this morning, the <org reg="National Catholic Welfare Conference">National
					Catholic Welfare Council</org> or Conference. It has been the cause of a great
				deal of malicious confusion, and first I want to read into the record a letter from
				the <org>Bureau of Jewish Social Research</org> of <place reg="New York, NY">New
					York City</place> in answer to this circular. It is directed to one of the
				representatives who sent it, and the letter, of which I have a copy, reads as
				follows: </p>

			<p>
				<q who="BURHI">Mr. <person reg="Burton, Hiram Ralph">Burton</person>: I think we
					should know what the statement is that was made by the National Catholic Welfare
					Council.</q>
			</p>


			<p>
				<q who="GILFR">Senator Gillett: Does that statement appear there?</q>
			</p>

			<p> Mrs. Sanger: I have it here .It is an official statement by the National Catholic
				Welfare Council. </p>

			<p>
				<q who="GILFR">Senator Gillett: That may be filed then. </q>
			</p>

			<p> Mrs. Sanger: It is far too long to quote it. </p>
			<p> The reply to the circular is as follows: </p>
			<p>
				<supplied resp="MSPP">The reply to the circular has been omitted by the MSPP
					editors.</supplied>
			</p>

			<p> Mr. Chairman, that letter represents the feeling on the part of a very large number
				of social organizations from whom we also have heard. I have not attempted to enter
				the statements into the record because yesterday the chairman stated that he would
				not include all of the letters that were sent on the subject. </p>
			<p> Just as briefly as I can I should like to comment on the discussion that went on
				this morning. </p>
			<p> The inference has been, and it has been constantly stated, that the bill that we are
				proposing would open the United States mails and common carriers to pornographic and
				obscene literature. The circular to which reference has been made included such a
				statement. I deny that allegation. I think that such statements wilfully
				misrepresent what this bill specifically intends to do. It is untrue to say that the
				bill would practically remove all existing restriction. We only ask that the medical
				profession in this country should have the right to receive contraceptive articles
				and literature, and that medical journals should have the right to issue such
				articles, which are almost always of a scientific nature. I should think that the
				medical profession would resent the statements made here this morning that the
				articles which we are asking to have legally sent through the United States mails
				are articles that might be designated as pornographic and obscene. I should think
				that was and should be considered an insult to the profession. </p>
			<p> I want to read to you two of the resolutions that have been passed by branches or
				departments of the <org>American Medical Association</org>. The American Medical
				Association itself has not taken a stand on this bill, but I wish to point out that
				two of its principal departments or sections have put themselves on record in favor
				of the principle of this kind of legislation. The first resolution was passed by the
				section on obstetrics, gynecology, and abdominal surgery at <place
					reg="Atlantic City, NJ">Atlantic City</place>, May 29, 1925: </p>
			<q who="AMA">
				<p> Resolved, That we hereby recommend the authorization of existing laws wherever
					necessary so that physicians may legally give contraceptive information to the
					patients in the regular course of practice. </p>
			</q>
			<p> Further, the <org reg="American Gynecological and Obstetrical Society">American
					Gynecological Society</org> at the same time indorsed the following amendment to
				the existing Federal laws: “Standard medical works, standard medical and scientific
				journals, and reprints therefrom, which contain information with reference to the
				prevention of conception are not nonmaliable under this section.” </p>
			<p> Now, Mr. Chairman, these are the two departments or sections of the American Medical
				Association most intimately concerned with the question of contraception, with child
				bearing, and with mothers’ and womens’ health. </p>
			<p> When the <org>American Federation of Labor</org> went on record, as far as the
				letter read this morning was concerned, you will note that it referred to a bill of
				1925, a bill that was not sponsored by the committee that supports Senate bill 4582
				now. This is the first time that this bill has ever been introduced in the Senate,
				and the opposition of the Federation of Labor, according to the letter and the
				statement made here this morning, was directed to another kind of bill entirely.
				This bill, as you will see, asks only that the medical profession, medical books,
				journals and reprints therefrom, and articles designed for the prevention of
				conception, used by the medical profession in hospitals, clinics, and so forth,
				shall have the right to use the United States mails and common carriers. </p>
			<p> The circular sent out by the National Catholic Welfare Conference may have been
				responsible for the confusion as it stated that the bill was drafted and introduced
				at the request of the <org>Voluntary Parenthood League</org>. That statement is
				untrue. This bill is sponsored by the Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
				Control, and it has not been endorsed by the Voluntary Parenthood League at all. </p>
			<p> Now, Mr. Chairman, if I may just briefly take a little time to go through some of
				the other points that were made this morning, just the essential points, I will not
				take a great deal of your time. </p>
			<p> Mrs. Sanger: Dr. <person reg="Cattell, W. Henry">Henry Cattell</person> referred to
				certain contraceptive materials this morning. He called them “Sanger Pro-Tex Tubes,”
				and the implication was that I sponsored the devices named. I have never sanctioned
				nor given permission for the use of my name nor indorsed any article on
				contraception. Nor have I allowed the use of my name for any commercial purposes
				whatsoever, and I protest against the statement and the insinuation that certain
				devices and medical supplies have my name or my sanction. Something was said here
				this morning about the <org reg="Soviet Union Government">Soviet Government of
					Russia</org> approving of birth control. That is immaterial, absolutely
				immaterial. The whole birth-control movement was begun in this country in 1914
				before there was a Soviet Government, and indeed I feel highly complimented if we
				have been able to bring sane, safe, and constructive ideas about the control of
				population to the Soviet Government. </p>
			<p> I want to say also that not only governments like Russia, but the <org
					reg="United Kingdom Government">British Government</org> has also gone on record
				through certain of its departments as approving of the practice of birth control.
				Just within the last year the <org reg="Lambeth Conference of Anglican Bishops"
					>Lambeth Conference</org> in <place>England</place> sanctioned the right of
				individuals to practice birth control according to their conscience. </p>
			<p> The <org>British Medical Association</org> has also gone on record in favor and the
					<org reg="United Kingdom Ministry of Health">Ministry of Health</org> in England
				has approved the practice of allowing the patients who come to the maternal and
				infant welfare centers to have contraceptive advice by Government authority, so that
				all governments are seeking some solution to this question of population. </p>
			<p> I also want to say, Mr. Chairman, that we who are advocating this bill are trying to
				do away with the surreptitious and harmful information that is at present being
				spread around the country without being authorized, or controlled by experts who
				have the right to give it. I believe that the only way to do away with the harmful
				information which has been mentioned here this morning is to put the subject in the
				hands of medical profession to be properly controlled. </p>
			<p> When some one says that the happiest families are the largest ones, and that the
				world’s great leaders have been large families, I would like to all to your
				attention that the great leader of Christianity, <person>Jesus Christ</person>
				himself, was said to be an only child. </p>
			<p> Now, Mr. Chairman, I am not going to take much time, but I want to say that the
				controversy really concerns the question of differing methods of birth control. The
				method of self-control recommended by some of those who are here to-day, is open to
				them. They may use such methods. We are not imposing any method upon any
				individuals. There are said to be 120,000,000 people in this country, and I suppose
				that a large part of that number, perhaps 15,000,000, we will say to be generous, or
				even 20,000,000. are Catholics, but there are 105,000,000 left who are
				non-Catholics. They are not imposing any legislation upon the Catholics. We in no
				way try to inflict our ideas upon them. They have a perfect right to use the method
				of self-control if they wish, but we do believe that we have just as much right
				under the Constitution to enjoy health, peace, and the right to the pursuit of
				happiness as we see it. </p>
			<p> So I want to say that this whole group this morning, who have represented perhaps
				certain moral organizations of the country, seem to me to be like the boy who is
				whistling to keep up courage. No doubt there has been a falling away from grace, we
				might say, in the past several years, and they who represent such moral standards
				must see that they have failed to a considerable extent when we consider that they
				have had so much power. They have had the laws with them, the wealth, the press, and
				yet they have come to-day to say they are afraid of the morals of their people if
				they have knowledge, if they do not continue to be kept in fear and ignorance. Then
				I say their moral teachings are not very deep. </p>
			<p> I want to say just one thing further. We have birth-control clinics that are legally
				operating throughout the United States, and in almost every one of the birth-control
				clinics we have the same records. Women come to us, regardless of religion,
				desperate women, women trying to live decently, trying to avoid the conditions that
				unwanted pregnancy and too frequent pregnancy bring. These women come in equal
				proportions. It runs about 33 per cent Protestant, 32 per cent Catholics, and 31 per
				cent Jewish women. They all come with the same cry, “Give us a chance to space our
				children. It is not that we do not love children, because we do love them; but
				because we want to give them a better chance than we have had, and we know that
				another child born into this family only deprives the children that are already here
				of a decent living with the ideals that we have for them.”</p>
			<p> Further, when you get 500 Catholic women in one clinic, with confessions of 597
				abortions, Mr. Chairman, I say that it is time for us all to consider this problem
				intelligently. It is time for us all to consider a fundamental need, the fundamental
				question that is involved here. Catholic women are no different from any other
				women. It is all the same. The great majority of women who come to birth-control
				clinics are seeking some means of controlling the size of their family because
				heretofore they have had to resort to these harmful methods. This is what we are
				trying to eliminate. We are trying to save mothers from this great hardship, from
				this unnatural ordeal. In the past many women who desired to control the size of
				their families have had to resort to an interruption of pregnancy, a method of which
				we disapprove, and which this law is going to do away with eventually, I am quite
				certain. </p>
			<p> Mr. Chairman, we say that we want children conceived in love, born of parents’
				conscious desire, and born into the world with healthy and sound bodies and sound
				minds. </p>
