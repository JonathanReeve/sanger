		<head>BIRTH CONTROL SPEAKER URGES SENSIBLE LAWS</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p><q who="IS">Speaking in the crystal ball room of <org>Hotel Boise</org>, Friday
					evening, <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, advocate of
					birth control, told why she had spent the last 20 years of her life trying to
					amend a law which was passed more than 60 years ago.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="IS">She declared that were it possible for birth control information to be
					given legally, the country would benefit and future citizens would be of a
					higher type of human beings. The bill now pending on <org
						reg="United States Congress">congress</org> is in the <org
						reg="United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary">judiciary
						committee</org>, of which Senator <person reg="Borah, William Edgar"
						>Borah</person> is a member.</q></p>
			<p> “Birth control laws were passed by congress 63 years ago,” <q who="IS">she said.</q>
				“A <name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">federal
					law</name> now exists which makes it impossible for scientific or medical
				literature or supplies to be sent through the mails or common carriers.”</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Doctors Not Exempted</head>
			<p> “This law makes no exemption to the medical profession, nor to hospitals nor to
				medical colleges. It makes it a crime of five years in prison or $5,000 fine for
				anyone to send or receive through the <org reg="United States Postal Service">U.S.
					mails</org> any information on birth control. It also makes it a crime to send
				the address of a doctor or of a hospital or clinic through mails where such
				information might be obtained.</p>
			<p> “The state laws are different. Nearly all of the state laws exclude and exempt the
				medical profession so that it is perfectly legal for a doctor in the state of
					<place>Idaho</place> to give oral information to his patients.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Trying to Save Lives</head>
			<p> “We are trying to change this federal law. We are trying to amend this congressional
				law to exempt hospitals, doctors and medical colleges from the penalty of the law.
				Our bill is now in the judiciary committee of the <org reg="United States Senate"
					>senate</org>, of which Senator Borah is a member. By the amending of this law
				through our bill, we can save thousands of woman and save the state tax payers from
				filling up institutions with a generation of children who are bound to become a
				burden upon society,” <q who="IS">she said.</q></p>		
			<p> <q who="IS">Out of about 250 present, 125 signed cards saying they were interested in Mrs.
					Sanger’s work, and 60 who expressed a desire for a clinic in <place
						reg="Boise, ID">Boise</place>. This matter will be discussed with Mrs.
					Sanger today.</q></p>
			<p> <q who="IS">There were 95 at the luncheon at the <org>Owyhee hotel</org> Friday noon to meet
					Mrs. Sanger.</q></p>
