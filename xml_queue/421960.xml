		<head>State Birth Control Instruction Is Proposed By Margaret Sanger</head>
		<div type="section">
			<q who="HP">
				<p> Birth control instruction in the public health programs of the states and the
						<org reg="United States, Government of">Federal Government</org> is the goal
					of the <org>Birth Control Federation of America</org>, the federation’s honorary
					president, Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person>, said in
						<place reg="El Paso, TX">El Paso</place> today.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="HP">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger, youthful and brimming with health and enthusiasm, arrived today
					from <place reg="Tucson, AZ">Tucson</place> to pay an official visit to the
						<org>El Paso Mother’s Health Center</org>. She spoke today at the <org
						reg="El Paso Kiwanis Club">Kiwanis Club</org> at <org>Hotel Cortez</org> and
					at the Health Center to mothers and to the board of directors.</p>
			</q>
			<q who="HP">
				<p>Citing the increase of the national birth rate of "over a million a year<q
						who="HP">,” she said she refused to weep crocodile tears over our falling
						birth rate.</q></p>
				<p>
					<q who="HP">She said that, "</q>young married couples in love will have babies<q
						who="HP">,” regardless of the predictions that the better class of people
						will not with birth control knowledge.</q></p>
				<p> “They will get an economic footing and have their babies<q who="HP">,” she
						said.</q> “They want to reproduce the one they love.”</p>
				<q who="HP">
					<p> The Birth Control Federation of America now incorporates all the birth
						control activities and clinics in the <place>United States</place> under its
						direction, Mrs. Sanger said. She told of the increase, by 125, of the
						privately directed clinics, now 480 in the past two years.</p>
				</q>
				<p> “The total of 480 clinics does not include clinics operated by civic
					organizations in communities,” <q who="HP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “<place
						reg="North Carolina">North</place> and <place>South Carolina</place> have
					included birth control instruction in their public health programs.”</p>
				<p>
					<q who="HP"> The South will lead the country in putting birth control
						instruction in the public health programs, Mrs. Sanger predicted.</q>

			<head type="sub"> South Sees Need</head>
			<p> “The South sees the need in her own confines,” <q who="HP">she said.</q></p>
			<q who="HP">
				<p> Birth control is not only a national but an international need, the
					internationally known woman said.</p>

			<head type="sub"> Crowded Nations</head>
			<p> “<place>Germany</place>, <place>Italy</place> and <place>Japan</place>, the three
				high pressure nations, have become the danger spots to the peace of the world,” <q
					who="HP">she said.</q> “While they make their claim for more territory and
				colonies, they are not content to cut down their birth rate and keep their
				population within their national resources. They too wish to increase their
				population for military strength.”</p>
			<q who="HP">
				<p> She emphasized that Germany’s population in 1935 was 67,000,000, only one
					million less than it was in 1914, after which there was a loss of 10 million in
					the World War and 27,000 square miles in territory.</p>

			<head type="sub"> Talks to Kiwanians</head>
			<p> “In other words, her present population and density is back to explosion point of
				1914 which caused the World War,” <q who="HP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “There is no use
				asking any nation to reduce its armaments without reducing its birth rates. There
				has got to be an equalization of birth rates as well as of territory if we will have
				peace.”</p>
			<q who="HP">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger defined birth control for the Kiwanians today. She pointed out that
					birth control does not interfere with life.</p>
			</q>
			<p> “It is a conscious control of the birth rate by means that prevent conception,” <q
					who="HP">she said.</q> “It does not kill, does not interfere with life. It is
				‘control’ and not ‘limit.’”</p>

			<head type="sub"> 150,000 Useless Deaths</head>
			<q who="HP">
				<p> The United States has not reduced its maternity mortality rate in 20 years, Mrs.
					Sanger said.</p>
			</q>
			<p> “A total of 150,000 mothers and infants died in 1937,” <q who="HP">she said.</q>
				“More than one-half of them could have been saved through scientific knowledge if it
				had been applied. The opponents of birth control must take a large share of
				responsibility for their deaths. The report of the <org
					reg="United States Children's Bureau">Children’s Bureau</org>, from which I got
				these figures, shows that where there is spacing of children in a family, there are
				147 infant deaths out of 1000, when only one year apart. While 95 deaths occur in
				1000 where there is two years of spacing between babies.</p>
			<p> “Sixty-five per cent of the babies born in 1937 were in families either on relief or
				with incomes of less than $20 a week,” <q who="HP">she said.</q></p>

		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Hits Old Age Theory</head>
			<p> “There are 13,000,000 children in families on relief, or with a total income of less
				than $15 a week,” <q who="HP">she said.</q></p>
			<p> “I object to the philosophy that parents have the right to have children to sustain
				them in their old age,” <q who="HP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “With the labor saving
				machines fast taking the place of man labor, by the time the children born today
				will be able to assist their parents, machines will have superseded those children.
				Their labor will not be needed. But the laws of a humane government will further
				advance the age of exploitation of children. Children will be kept longer in school.
				It is a short sighted policy of any group to encourage the birth of children in this
				strata of our population.”</p>
