		<head>Will <place>China</place> accept the principles of Birth Control?</head>
		<p>This is the question asked almost universally by people of the Western world.</p>
		<p>The general belief is that she will not accept these principles not because the benefits
			of such practicewould not be obvious to her but because she is so entrenched in the age
			long habits of other beliefs, contradictory to Birth Control, that it would take a
			psychological revolution to upset them.</p>
		<p>Their contention is to let China alone, let her work out her population problems by
			herself. But we will <emph rend="underline">not</emph> let China alone. The Western
			nations have long invaded her shores and not always to China's benefit. Now we know that
			Birth Control has been practiced in the Western Countries much to those countries
			benefit. Is there any reason to believe the same benefit would not be right for
			China?</p>
		<p>I believe China will accept Birth Control, not perhaps at one swallow, but rapidly in the
			next few years. Already there has been great interest in the question, especially among
			the younger generation.</p>
		<p>It is in that generation China's destiny is to change and it will change, perhaps
			dramatically. And Birth Control must precede any great permanent change in her social
			system, for birth control is first &amp; foremost a principle of freedom and social
			right, and next a great very great indeed economic expedient.</p>
