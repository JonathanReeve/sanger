			<p>My message to the parents of the children in starving countries is to declare a
				Moratorium on the birth rate for the next ten years. Why ten years? I am asked.
				Because it is going to take from six to ten years for the world to get settled again
				and the conditions of poverty misery hunger and strife which exist in the world
				today are not the conditions in which to have and rear happy and healthy children. </p>
			<p>Women in war torn countries write me that they are giving birth to death not to life.
				To bring children into these conditions is not kind nor fair to those already born
				and to those unborn. So again I say to hungry mothers and fathers-declare the
				Moratorium on the birth rate, with which we can make a better world.</p>

			<head>10 year Moratorium on Europe Babies Urged</head>
			<p><q who="NYDN">A 10-year moratorium on babies in the world’s hungry countries was
					urged yesterday by Mrs. Margaret Sanger Slee, noted advocate of planned
					parenthood, as she left LaGuardia Field for a family planning conference in
					England.</q> "Those countries should not have another child for a decade," <q
					who="NYDN">she said.</q> "They should do all in their power to help keep women
				from having children for that period-until the food and economic situations are
				adjusted there.</p>
			<p><q who="NYDN">She said her plan “definitely” includes England. </q></p>
			<p>"I think the adults who are living today could be moved into those countries where
				they need labor,"<q who="NYDN">she continued.</q> "Use the manpower that’s there
				today, and don’t bring any more children into the world to starve." </p>
			<p><q who="NYDN">Somebody asked who would fight the wars, and Mrs. Slee replied,</q> "At
				least there would be fewer people to be battered to death."</p>
			<p><q who="NYDN">Mrs. Slee left on the American Overseas Flagship Eire.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYDN">She said that while abroad she also will work on arrangements for an
					international population conference to be held in <place reg="Oxford, England"
						>Oxford</place>next year. This will deal with the problem of populations in
					relation to the food supplies and natural resources of countries. She said all
					overpopulated countries, including <place>India</place>, <place>China</place>,
					and <place>Japan</place>, would be invited to send representatives.</q></p>
			<p>"In this country we have achieved a favorable balance of population and resources,<q
					who="NYDN">she stated.</q> "This situation has contributed greatly to the
				raising of our national standard of living."</p>
			<p>"But it will do us little good if in the end European and Asiatic countries, and some
				of our possessions, continue to overflow their boundaries, crowd their resources and
				breed themselves into new famines. Many of them will ultimately breed themselves
				into another war. For these reasons the whole world should be interested in
				intelligent limitations of populations."</p>

			<head>Mrs. Sanger's Plan Opposed by Britons</head>
			<p>"I suppose my ideas will upset all my friends, <q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said. </q>
				"Unsound? Not a bit of it. There is pretty heavy overcrowding in <place
					reg="Great Britain">Britain</place>. Adults could be moved to other countries
				instead of having babies here while food is short."</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head>American Birth Control Pioneer Stirs British Anger</head>
			<p><q who="EI">It all started when gray-haired little Mrs. Sanger stepped off a plane
					and told the press:</q> "It’s pretty certain that the world won’t be able to
				produce enough food to support any more babies for at least 10 years."<q who="EI"
					>So, she said, women should stop having babies for 10 years--in Britain,
					especially. She wanted <org>the United Nations</org>to recommend baby quotas for
					all countries.</q></p>
