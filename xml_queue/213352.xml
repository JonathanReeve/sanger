		<head>Moratorium on Babies</head>
		<p>My message to the parents of the children in starving countries is to declare a
			Moratorium on the birth rate for the next ten years. Why ten years? I am asked. Because
			it is going to take from six to ten years for the world to get settled again and the
			conditions of poverty misery hunger and strife which exist in the world today are not
			the conditions in which to have and rear happy and healthy children. </p>
		<p>Women in war torn countries write me that they are giving birth to death not to life. To
			bring children into these conditions is not kind nor fair to those already born and to
			those unborn. So again I say to hungry mothers and fathers-declare the Moratorium on the
			birth rate, with which we can make a better world.</p>
		<p><supplied rend="MSPP">The following quotes came from the New York Daily News.</supplied>
			<q who="NYDN">A 10-year moratorium on babies in the world’s hungry countries was urged
				yesterday by <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs. Margaret Sanger Slee</person>,
				noted advocate of planned parenthood, as she left <place reg="LaGuardia Airport"
					>LaGuardia Field</place> for a family planning conference in England.</q>Those
			countries should not have another child for a decade, <q who="NYDN">she said.</q>They
			should do all in their power to help keep women from having children for that
			period-until the food and economic situations are adjusted there.<q who="NYDN">She said
				her plan “definitely” includes England. </q>I think the adults who are living today
			could be moved into those countries where they need labor,<q who="NYDN">she
				continued.</q>Use the manpower that’s there today, and don’t bring any more children
			into the world to starve. <q who="NYDN">Somebody asked who would fight the wars, and
					<person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs. Slee</person>replied,</q>At least there
			would be fewer people to be battered to death.<q who="NYDN">Mrs. Slee left on the
				American Overseas Flagship Eire. She said that while abroad she also will work on
				arrangements for an international population conference to be held in <place
					reg="Oxford, England">Oxford</place>next year. This will deal with the problem
				of populations in relation to the food supplies and natural resources of countries.
				She said all overpopulated countries, including <place>India</place>,
					<place>China</place>, and <place>Japan</place>, would be invited to send
				representatives.</q>In this country we have achieved a favorable balance of
			population and resources,<q who="NYDN">she stated.</q> This situation has contributed
			greatly to the raising of our national standard of living.</p>
		<p>But it will do us little good if in the end European and Asiatic countries, and some of
			our possessions, continue to overflow their boundaries, crowd their resources and breed
			themselves into new famines. Many of them will ultimately breed themselves into another
			war. For these reasons the whole world should be interested in intelligent limitations
			of populations.</p>
		<p><supplied rend="MSPP">The following quotes came from the New York Times.</supplied>
			<q who="NYT">Mrs.Sanger’s Plan Opposed by Britons</q>I suppose my ideas will upset all
			my friends, <q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said. </q>Unsound? Not a bit of it. There is pretty
			heavy overcrowding in <place reg="England">Britain</place>. Adults could be moved to
			other countries instead of having babies here while food is short.</p>
		<p><supplied rend="MSPP">The following quotes came from the Evening Independent.</supplied>
			<q who="EI">It all started when gray-haired little Mrs. Sanger stepped off a plane and
				told the press:</q>It’s pretty certain that the world won’t be able to produce
			enough food to support any more babies for at least 10 years.<q who="EI">So, she said,
				women should stop having babies for 10 years-- in Britain, especially. She wanted
					<org>the United Nations</org>to recommend baby quotas for all countries.</q></p>
