		<p>Dr. <person reg="Dewey, John">Dewey</person>, Miss <person reg="Phillips, Lena Madesin">
				Phillips</person>, Ladies and Gentlemen: You must all know that my heart is too full
			to express adequately my gratitude in words. Sitting here listening to all these
			touching and beautiful tributes, I asked myself, “Is it really true? Am I awake or is it
			all a pleasant dream?” For after nearly twenty years of indictment, suppressions,
			courts, jails, patrol wagons and police raids, it is simply wonderful. (Laughter and
			applause) It is wonderful to receive something besides a warrant. (Laughter)</p>
		<p>Miss Phillips, I shall always prize this medal, not so much as a reward for my humble
			achievements in a great cause, but to me this symbolizes public recognition of
			representative courageous women, of the basic importance of birth control as a necessary
			instrument in the making of our civilization.</p>
		<p>In conferring upon me this honor, I feel that you are entering this battle for a new
			civilization and that is why this means so much to me. The memory of it will go with me
			in the thick of the fight, in moments of weariness and discouragement. It will reassure
			me that I am no longer alone in this battle for knowledge, but that intelligent,
			courageous groups of women are standing not only behind us but shoulder to shoulder with
			us in spirit. (applause)</p>
		<p>I wonder if I can take this opportunity to tell you something of the work that we have
			been doing in <place reg="Washington, DC">Washington</place>. When I think of Washington
			in the past five months that I spent there, I feel that we have gone into the
			Congressional trenches, so to speak. Our little group of workers, valiant, intrepid,
			have been a sort of shock troop in trying to get our bill introduced in Congress.</p>
		<p>When we arrived there last December, the very air seemed surcharged with all the
			important, pressing problems of the day. The mind of each Senator and each
			representative seemed like a busy telephone switchboard.It was difficult to plug in
			anywhere because every wire was busy. It was busy with questions such as war debts,
			reparations, moratoriums, unemployment relief, tariffs, as well as war in <place
				reg="Manchuria, China">Manchuria</place>, peace conferences and disarmament,
			prohibition, budgets and finally bonuses. Now what chance had we to plug in with a
			question like birth control in that hectic atmosphere? As a matter of fact, the very
			mention of birth control to the hectic, worried, troubled Congressmen was very much like
			announcing a messenger from Mars, except that I think that would have been more
			interesting and not quite so remote.</p>
		<p>“<q who="UNK">Busy:</q>” “<q who="UNK">Busy in conference:</q>” “<q who="UNK">Busy in
				committee meetings:</q>” “<q who="UNK">Busy on the telephone;</q>” “<q who="UNK">No
				time to see you:</q>” “<q who="UNK">No time to talk about this subject, come back
				later:</q>” “<q who="UNK">Come back tomorrow:</q>” “<q who="UNK">Come back next
				week:</q>” “<q who="UNK">Come back after your bill has been
			introduced,</q>”--anything to get rid of you, anything to get you out of the way.</p>
		<p>Always we came back promptly and on the hour. Some days our workers called upon thirty to
			forty Congressmen with the result of seeing perhaps one or two of them. In fact, we
			considered two interviews a good day’s work. Up to date, we have seen and talked to and
			we think partially converted, more than 200 Congressmen and over 50 Senators.
			(Applause).</p>
		<p>We found that the great difficulty was misunderstanding. We further found that the great
			majority of these men were both badly informed and misinformed. Of course, we found that
			the younger men, some of the newer ones, knew something of the pros and cons of birth
			control. One could easily know that by the size of their own families. But when it came
			to asking for a law to allow others to have the same privileges that they had had, the
			subject became a serious one that had to have their due consideration. Nevertheless, we
			found that the main thing that hung over them all like a pall was fear--fear of
			prejudice, fear of cloakroom joshing, I hesitate to say "kidding". (Laughter) But more
			than all was fear of out opponents. Our opponents are skilled in the art as well as the
			science of tactics. We find that they move to block our every move and plan before we
			have scarcely known it ourselves. They move in bloc and group activity. Our supporters,
			as you <supplied resp="MSPP">know,</supplied> give us casual and individual support, but
			the opposition moves en masse and there is no use in our trying to compete with them in
			those tactics.</p>
		<p>So we had to outmaneuver them in another way. We met them in the tactics of psychology.
			Theirs is the weapon of fear; ours, the inspiring instrument of courage. Finally, we
			inspired one Congressman to have the courage to introduce our bill (applause),
			Congressman <person reg="Hancock, Franklin Wills, Jr.">Frank Hancock</person>, of <place
				reg="Winston-Salem, NC"> Winston-Salem, North Carolina</place>! (Applause)</p>
		<p>I have here a telegram from a Senator who says:</p>
		<p>"<q who="HATHE">Please extend my regrets to those responsible for inviting me to the
				banquet in your honor, in my inability to attend as much as I would like
			to.</q>"</p>
		<p>He goes on and says something about the question of birth control, its humaneness and
			justification, and then he says, "<q who="HATHE">I will introduce it.</q>"
			(Applause)</p>
		<p>This is Senator <person reg="Hatfield, Henry D.">Hatfield </person>, of <place>West
				Virginia</place>. (Applause)</p>
		<p>We have had our eye on Senator Hatfield for a long time. (Laughter) He has shoulders as
			broad as this table and a jaw equally as strong. We feel that in getting him to take an
			interest in this cause, he will put his back into it also, he will put his teeth into
			it, and I am sure he will never let go until it is won. (Applause)</p>
		<p>Now all this, friends, means that we have had our bill introduced in the <org
				reg="United States House of Representatives">House</org> ; it is about to be
			introduced in the Senate. This lovely meeting, this distinguished committee, this award,
			all mean that we are on our way to victory. Who can compute the tremendous suffering
			saved the human race when this bill shall be passed? For I firmly believe that when the
			fear of pregnancy is eliminated from the lives of women, heaven will be millions of
			miles nearer this earth. I believe that much of the social, economic and crime chaos
			that exists in the world today extends directly back to the reckless breeding of our
			forebears. As a result, we see countless men and women here today whose lives are
			enmeshed and entangled by the prejudice and the ignorance of the past. We must
			disentangle their lives. We must release them from ignorance and fear. We must free them
			from tyrannical laws. We must direct our own efforts and our own energies into settling
			questions that we know so well and in order to enlarge and explore the sphere of the
			unknown, the sphere of real life. We know that in every village, hamlet and town in this
			country women are living troubled and tortured lives through fear: many of them come
			appealing to us for help, but out of our reach millions are helplessly inarticulate,
			like doomed souls crushed beneath the weight of a cruelly prolific nature. It is these
			women we are dedicated to free.</p>
		<p>This medal, this award shall be the pledge to bind us together and to spur us on to the
			continuation of our fight for the liberation of womankind. Thank you!</p>
		<p>...The audience arose and applauded...</p>
