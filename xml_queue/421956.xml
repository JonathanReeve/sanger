		<p><q who="TAYRE">How do you fit ‘Birth Control’ into a world in which dictators are
				clamoring for more and more and yet more people?</q></p>
		<p><q who="TAYRE">In answer to this question, Margaret Sanger, pioneer of ‘birth control,’
				replied:</q> "I can only answer momentum must now derive its power from some other
			source than arousing sympathy. The present insensitivity is due to a horror of hovering
			peril. Man will be swept away and destroyed but when the battered hulls of the various
			ships of state will emerge into calmer seas, a lesson may have been learned, perhaps,
			whereby these vessels may be made more seaworthy."</p>
		<p>"To have helped carry the cause thus far has been at times strenuous but I have never
			considered it a sacrifice. Every conscious hour, night and day, in any city, in any
			country, has brought its compensations. My life has been joyous and exulting and full
			because it has touched profoundly millions of other lives. it is ever a privilege to be
			a part of something unquestionably proved of value, something so fundamentally right.
			Battles over impiety, heresy, blasphemy, obscenity, have been fought, temporarily lost
			and finally won. Science whittles away at such obstructions little by little. In January
			1937 in that same <org>Town Hall</org>, where fifteen years before I had been forbidden
			to speak, and whence I had been hauled into court, I was honored with a MEDAL."</p>
		<p>"<person reg="Buck, Pearl S.">Pearl Buck</person>said on one occasion, ‘The cause
			conquers because YOUTH is for you. I have lived in <place>China</place>so long, and know
			what it is to wait until the OLD ONES DIE and the young can do what is necessary to be
			done.’”</p>
