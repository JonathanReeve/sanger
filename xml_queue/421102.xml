			<q who="LAT">Just back from a tour of the Western States, Miss <person
					reg="Smith, Gladys Delancey">Gladys Delancey Smith</person>, regional director
				of the <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org>, will
				direct attention to an educational program.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="LAT">In receipt of communication from Mrs. Margaret Sanger, president and
				founder of the national committee, Miss Smith is jubilant. The Sanger letter
				states:</q>
		</p>
		<p>“The greatest legal victory in the birth control movement was just won when the
				<org>United States Circuit Court of Appeals</org> for the Second Circuit unanimously
			upheld <person reg="Moscowitz, Grover M.">Judge Moscowitz</person>'s decision liberating
			the medical profession, hospitals and other health agencies from legal restrictions. </p>
		<p>“We are proceeding on two fronts, judicial and legislative, and this decision has
			established our claim so clearly that there is now no need for us to ask <org
				reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> for further legislation regarding the
			rights of the medical profession.</p>
		<p>“This victory is due in large measure to the pressure of public opinion, as clearly shown
			not only by the millions who have endorsed our Federal work but also by the recent poll
			of the <org>Institute of Public Opinion.”</org>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="LAT">That it is the duty of licensed physicians to aid in the committee's
				educational program is the belief of Mrs. Sanger who has established headquarters
				here at 350 South Figueroa Street, Studio D, with Miss Smith in charge. Plans are
				being perfected by Miss Smith for the formal reception and entertainment of <person
					reg="Kato, Shidzue Ishimoto">Baronness Ishimoto</person> of
				<place>Japan</place>, who will arrive here January 25. She is known as the "Margaret
				Sanger" of Japan.</q>
