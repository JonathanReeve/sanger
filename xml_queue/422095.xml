		<p><q who="ECL">Limitation of population is needed at this time</q> "when poverty and
			unemployment are rampant over the country," <q who="ECL">Mrs. Margaret Sanger asserted
				today in urging the House ways and means committee to approve dissemination of birth
				control information.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="ECL">Mrs. Sanger commended a bill by <person reg="Hancock, Franklin Wills Jr."
					>Rep. Hancock</person>, <org reg="Democratic Party">Dem</org>., <place
					reg="North Carolina">N. C.</place>, which would remove long-standing Federal
				restrictions against transmission of birth control information through the mails.
				The bill would enable licensed medical centers to disseminate such information.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="ECL">Today's hearing was the first a <org
					reg="United States House of Representatives, Committee on Ways and Means">House
					committee</org> had given to birth control advocates since 1873.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q who="ECL">Passage of the measure</q> "would directly benefit the large army of women
			whose husbands are unemployed," <q who="ECL">Mrs. Sanger said</q>.</p>
