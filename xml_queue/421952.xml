		<head>'Totalitarians' Called <place reg="United States">U.S.</place> Foes of Birth
			Control</head>
		<p>
			<q who="NYHT">Mrs. Margaret Sanger, pioneer advocate of birth control education and
				chairman of the <org>Birth Control Federation of America</org>, said yesterday that
				she had information that there was an organized campaign under way, instigated
				by</q> “the totalitarian countries,” <q who="NYHT">to wreck the birth-control
				movement in the United States.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="NYHT">The protests which led to the barring of a birth-control exhibit at the
					<org>New York State Fair</org> at <place reg="Syracuse, NY">Syracuse</place>
				last week and the more recent barring of exhibits at the <org>Mineola Fair</org> at
					<place reg="Mineola, NY">Mineola</place>, L.I., and at a fair at <place
					reg="Detroit, MI">Detroit</place>, are the first outward signs, she said, of</q>
			“an insidious campaign to break up our movement.”</p>
		<p> “You are going to see it more and more,” <q who="NYHT">she asserted,</q> “closing up our
			clinics, stopping our meetings and banishing our exhibits.”</p>

		<p>
			<q who="NYHT"> The fifty-seven-year-old leader of the movement, which on Oct. 16 will
				celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the opening of the <org
					reg="Brownsville Clinic">first birth control clinic</org>, in the United States,
				said that she was frankly alarmed at the situation.</q>
		</p>

		<p>
			<q who="NYHT">Sitting in the library of the <org reg="Margaret Sanger Research Bureau"
					>Margaret Sanger Bureau</org>, 17 West Sixteenth Street, she said that she was
				not yet prepared to offer concrete evidence of her charge that the latest action
				against her movement was the result of subversive influence from abroad. The only
				way to fight it, she asserted, was for birth-control advocates to redouble their
				efforts to make birth-control advice part of the regular public health system.</q>
		</p>

		<p>
			<q who="NYHT">Asked what interest the totalitarian countries would have in interfering
				with birth-control here, Mrs. Sanger explained that the question of population is
				one very close to the European dictators.</q> “They know,” <q who="NYHT">she
				said,</q> “that if birth-control is done away with here misery and poverty will
			abound in this country and only in countries where such conditions exist can a
			dictatorship take hold.”</p>

		<p>
			<q who="NYHT"> The birth-control pioneer was particularly bitter at the action of
				Lieutenant Governor <person reg="Poletti, Charles">Charles Poletti</person> who, as
				Acting Governor, issued the ruling which resulted in the barring of the exhibit at
				the New York State Fair and indirectly in the taking of similar action at the
				Mineola Fair, which will be open from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="NYHT">Characterizing Mr. Poletti’s ruling that the birth-control advocates seek
				to contravene state law as</q> “the most stupid interference with the movement in
			twenty-five years,” <q who="NYHT">Mrs. Sanger said that by his ruling</q> “he played
			directly into the hands of totalitarian interests in this country.”</p>
		<p>
			<q who="NYHT">As a result, she stated, what was planned as a celebration on the
				forthcoming twenty-fifth anniversary will take the form of a nation-wide protest.
				Everywhere where there are groups affiliated with the Birth Control Federation of
				America there will be protests on the anniversary date, she announced.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="NYHT"> Mrs. Sanger recalled the opening of the first birth-control clinic on
				Oct. 16 1916, at 46 Amboy Street, in the Brownsville section of <place
					reg="Brooklyn, NY">Brooklyn</place>. In the four days that it remained open
				before the police closed it, she said, she, her sister, Mrs. <person
					reg="Byrne, Ethel Higgins">Ethel Byrne</person>, both of whom were nurses, and a
					<person reg="Mindell, Fania"><person reg="Stuyvesant, Elizabeth">few
						associates</person></person> spoke to 480 women who flocked to the little
				clinic for advice. Somewhat wistfully, Mrs. Sanger recalled that she and her sister
				“did” thirty days in the <org reg="Queens County Penitentiary">Queens County
					jail</org> when they lost the test case which grew out of their arrest at the
				clinic. Now, she reported, there are 619 clinics throughout the country.</q>
