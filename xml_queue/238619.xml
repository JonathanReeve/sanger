		<p>If the people of the <del>world</del>
			<add><place reg="United States">USA</place></add> will accept Asiatic level of living in
			order to keep the promises of our President well &amp; good--a most noble sacrifice(??)
			But let us accept it consciously &amp; know that not we alone but other Nations with our
			food standards must share our noble sentiments so that three billion of the
				<place>Earth</place>’s inhabitants may live on a survival quota.-- </p>
		<p>Perhaps this suggestion will arouse <del>the</del> our opponents’ curiosity let us see
			how willing they are to tighten their belts to see an <add>world</add> increased
			population decrease our own standards of living within the life time of those in this
			room.</p>
		<p>In other words we ask a people with reserve &amp; resources sufficient to yield a
			permanent basis for a healthy population to live joyfully &amp; prosper to sacrifice
			that condition for themselves &amp; their unborn children in exchange for a large
			recklessly concerned population of illiterate miserable, people constantly threatened by
				<add>large</add> families, malnutrition &amp; ever increasing poverty.</p>
		<p>USA &amp; <org reg="United Nations">UN</org> should have a Population &amp; Eugenic
			Policy with two experts in the President’s Cabinet and policy established that there are
			certain eugenic qualifications for reproduction &amp; definitely lay down the law--that
			these couples who cannot meet those qualifications <emph rend="underline">must not
				reproduce</emph>.</p>
		<p>Such qualifications &amp; requirements for reproducing will make the children born
			symbols of honor to our civilization.--</p>
		<p>Another suggestion I once made at a Social tea in the drawing room of <person
				reg="Mesta, Perle Skirvin">Mrs. Mesta</person> in <place reg="Newport, RI"
				>Newport</place>--when <person reg="Blank, Mrs.">Mrs. Blank</person> said she
			objected to BC because her lovely niece &amp; brilliant nephew each had only one child
			while all the “<q who="BLAMRS">riff raff</q>” were having dozens--</p>
		<p>I made the gentle suggestion to Mrs. Blank that perhaps her brilliant &amp; lovely
			relatives were also endowed with natural qualities of <emph rend="underline"
				>Responsibility</emph> toward educating &amp; rearing children they were not able
			financially to rear adequately-- Then I said suppose Mrs. Blank instead of your
			contributing large sums of money every year to the <org reg="Community Chest">community
				chest</org> to orphanages, <org>Red Cross</org> &amp; other charities &amp;
			Philanthropies but gave that total divided equally to your two relatives you might find
			they would be happy to launch a few more babes in this world if you agreed that the
			added offspring, maintenance was secured--</p>
		<p>She said “<q who="BLAMRS">That is a New Idea</q>”-- while a few Medical Schools, a very few
			have classes &amp; lectures on contraception. No college or university has a Population
			Department as they have departments of History department a or <add>Dept.</add>
			Mathematics etc. yet Population conditions pressure &amp; rate of growth are
			the basis of today’s world miseries &amp; problems &amp; threaten to grow worse.</p>
