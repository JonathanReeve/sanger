        <p><del>I want to add my words of thanks &amp; appreciation to those of <person
                    reg="Millikan, Helen">Mrs. Millikan</person>s</del></p>
        <p>I too want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation &amp; thanks to the <org
                reg="Western States Conference on Birth Control and Population Problems, Conference Committee"
                >Conference Committee</org> for its co-operation in making possible this Conference.
            Especially do I appreciate the devotion given by those men &amp; women of the Committee
            who <add>took time from their</add> professional duties to attend meetings &amp; to
            carry out the plans of the conference. Those who do the most, get the most done.</p>
        <p>The object of this conference is to call together those persons in these twelve Western
            States who <add>in the past</add> have shown an interest in the birth control or
            Population problem.</p>
        <p>We want to organize <del>the</del> a <org
                reg="National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control, Western States Region"
                >Western States Region</org> to co-operate with the <add>14</add>
            <org
                reg="National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control, Midwestern States Region"
                >Mid Western <add>States</add></org>
            <add> &amp; 11</add>
            <org
                reg="National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control, Easten States Region"
                >Eastern Regional States</org> on a National programme for Federal legislation.</p>
        <p><del>Already the 11 Eastern &amp; 14 Mid Western States are organizing working
                together</del>
        </p>
        <p>We want at this conference to discuss a plan to effect an amendment to a Federal law
            passed by <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> over 54 years ago.</p>
        <p>This law <name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Sec. 211</name>,
            was inspired &amp; drafted by <person reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony Comstock</person>
            was rushed through Congress the last day of its session amid great hurry &amp;
            confusion. Few Congressmen knew the nature of the law they were voting on.</p>
        <p>Within a few weeks after it became known much criticism &amp; indignation was amassed
            among the more progressive people &amp; over 66,000 signatures were sent in protest to
            Congress requesting the repeal of that law.</p>
        <p>Nothing however came of it &amp; no concentrated effort was put forth to repeal or amend
            it from that <unclear>time</unclear> (1876) to 1914 when the B.C. movement
                <del>arose</del> raised its <del>cry</del><add>voice</add> in <place
                reg="United States">America</place>.</p>
        <p>What is this law. What does it do?</p>
