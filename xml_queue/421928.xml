		<head>Birth Control Leader Hits at Archbishop</head>

		<dateline><place reg="Washington, DC">Washington</place>, <date value="1935-08-16">Aug.
				16</date>.--</dateline>
		<p>
			<q who="WH">A bitter attack on <person reg="Murray, John Gregory">Archbishop
					Murray’s</person> order that clergy in the <org reg="Archdiocese of St. Paul"
						><place reg="St. Paul, MN">St. Paul</place> archdiocese</org> announce at
				August 18 masses that communicants may not retain membership in birth control
				organizations was made here today by Margaret Sanger of the <org> National Committee
					on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org>.</q>
		</p>
		<p> “If Catholic prelates follow the example of Archbishop John Gregory Murray,” <q who="WH"
				>she asserted,</q> “Catholics will have to withdraw completely and irrevocably from
			civic, public and professional life.” </p>
		<p>“Catholics,” <q who="WH">said Mrs. Sanger,</q> “will soon have to emigrate from <place
				reg="United States">America</place> to some less enlightened country.”</p>
		<p> “Every Catholic physician who is a member of the <org
				reg="American Gynecological and Obstetrical Society">American Gynecological
				society</org>, the <org reg="American Neurological Association">American
				Neurological society</org> and the obstetrical section of the <org>American Medical
				Association</org> will have to sever his connection with these professional groups,
			(if Catholic prelates follow Archbishop Murray’s lead) for they indorse the principles
			of birth control,” <q who="WH">she charged.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="WH">Defending the Americanism of the birth control movement, Mrs. Sanger
				asserted it originated in this country.</q>
		</p>
		<p>“But the anti-birth control movement,” <q who="WH">she charged,</q> “takes its orders
			from <org reg="Roman Catholic Church">Rome</org>. When these orders call for the
			repudiation of the findings of science, for attempts to impose the will of minorities on
			majority groups, and for withdrawal from activity in community life, it is time to
			inquire which line of conduct is the more truly American.” </p>
