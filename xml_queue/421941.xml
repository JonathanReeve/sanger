		<head>Immunization Against Pregnancy Aim Of Birth Control Federation of U.S.</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p><q who="EPHP"> The <org>Birth Control Federation of America</org> is now working on
					temporary immunization against pregnancy, Mrs. Margaret Sanger told a group of
					social welfare workers and <org reg="El Paso Mothers' Health Center">Mother’s
						Health Center</org> directors at a meeting at the Health Center yesterday.
					There were 25 present.</q></p>

			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger conferred with workers, representing the various agencies
					in <place reg="El Paso, TX">El Paso</place>, on local problems. She discussed
					the progress of birth control in the <place>United States</place> and foreign
					countries.</q></p>

			<head type="sub"> Praises Center</head>
			<p> “Immunization for a temporary period against pregnancy is not far distant,” <q
					who="EPH">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “Research is going forward in this field. The
				Birth Control Federation of America is for this. It will be a wonderful day when it
				comes.”</p>

			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger said that sterilization of all persons with mental
					diseases of any kind, of syphilitics or persons with any transmissible disease
					should be provided for in the laws of every state.</q></p>

			<p> “Sterilization should go hand in hand with any preventive work,” <q who="EPHP">she
					said.</q></p>

			<p>
				<q who="EPHP">She praised the work of the El Paso Mother’s Health Center to the
					social workers and asked for their co-operation with the Center.</q></p>

		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> California Ready</head>
			<p> “<place>California</place> is ready to take up the question of birth control with
				the welfare workers,” <q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “There will be no official
				opposition. Governor <person reg="Olson, Culbert Levy">Olson</person> is heartily in
				accord with the idea. California will do a good work. <place>Tennessee</place> is
				next.”</p>

			<p><q who="EPHP"> Mrs. Sanger said that she recently visited the project in California
					where 43,000 families are provided for by the <org
						reg="United States Government">Federal Government</org> in a reservation
					while they are occupied with seasonal labor.</q></p>

			<p> “The asked me to come out there and see about establishing birth control clinics
				among these people,” <q who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “I found that clinics of
				the kind we have here in El Paso would not be possible with this group because of
				the lack of facilities for a setup. But birth control information will be given to
				them.”</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">New Dealer</head>

			<p><q who="EPHP"> Mrs. Sanger praised the governmental provision for the families she
					visited.</q></p>

			<p> “It almost made a New Dealer of me,” <q who="EPHP">she said.</q> “It is wonderful
				what the Government is doing for those families.”</p>

			<p><q who="EPHP"> Mrs. Sanger cited the “new population scare” that by 1960 there will
					be a stationary population and by 1980, a decline and that there will be fewer
					infants and children for primary grades while a larger number of older
					people.</q></p>

			<p> “This means that people living today are taking better care of themselves and will
				live longer,” <q who="EPHP">she said.</q> “More young people can marry and have two
				or three children while older ones will have ceased to bear after the second or
				third child.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Will Survive</head>
			<p> “It means that children born in a small family will survive through infancy and
				childhood and have better facilities for trade schools or colleges. With a
				stationary population our standard of living will soar upward. We will have an
				opportunity to assimilate into the American system those who are alive today. We’ll
				have a lower death rate, less unemployment. There will be fewer hands to compete
				with the machines for jobs. America is coming into an era where purely physical
				labor will not be an asset. She needs superior brains, high intellects, more
				integrity in politics and in administration of public health and welfare
				activities.”</p>
