		<p>Religion and tradition taught women to repress as disgusting and sinful all
			manifestations of the sexual impulse, with the result that in women more than in men the
			sexual impulse tends to be driven below the surface and to seek an outlet in remote and
			often unconscious paths, this being the great fact on which <person reg="Freud, Sigmund"
				>Freud</person> seized.</p>
		<p> We cannot regulate the sex life of man without considering that of woman, and it has
			become increasingly evident from recent investigations and studies that there is not and
			never has been a special sexual psychology of woman. It was an idea originating in
			monasteries and convents, and is now rapidly falling into discredit.</p>
		<p>It is the modern viewpoint of such scientist as <person reg="Briffault, Richard"
				>Briffault</person> that mammals as a whole show <del>less the sex impulse</del> the
			sex urge takes two forms--sex impulse and mating impulse, the latter being that desire
			or tendency to prolonged association of the sexes, as in courtship, marriage, and
			parental care and affection. This latter impulse, however, does not exist in the great
			majority of animals, while the sex impulse is almost universal and is the basic force
			behind or underlying the motives of the mating instinct in the primates.</p>
