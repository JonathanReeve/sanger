        <div>
            <p><q who="NYT">Encouraged by a world tour that showed “amazing” growth of the
                    birth-control movement, Margaret Sanger, president of the <org>National
                        Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org>, said here
                    yesterday that birth control may become a national political issue if the
                    pending Federal bill allowing birth control education is not passed.</q>
                <q who="NYT"> Mrs. Sanger, who arrived back via <place>California</place> on Sunday,
                    was interviewed yesterday afternoon in the apartment of <person
                        reg="Timme, Ida Haar">Mrs. Walter Timme</person> at 112 Central Park South.
                </q></p>
            <p><q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger explained that 800 organizations, representing more than
                    10,000,000 persons, had endorsed the principles of the bill, sponsored in <org
                        reg="United States Congress">Congress</org>by Representative <person
                        reg="Gassaway, Percy L.">Percy L. Gassaway</person>. She declared that the
                    opposition of certain religious groups to the teaching of birth control has been
                    "</q>crumbling<q who="NYT">" and she predicted that "</q>if intelligence has its
                    way<q who="NYT">" the bill will soon become law. She is leaving for <place
                        reg="Washington, DC">Washington</place> within a few days to push
                it.</q></p>
            <p>“There is no doubt that public opinion in this country is in favor of the
                birth-control bill now before Congress,” Mrs. Sanger said. “Reports indicate that
                Congress is giving the subject serious thought instead of treating it with a
                snicker, as was the case five years ago. Many lawmakers do not even know of the
                existence of the absurd law which hampers physicians in giving birth-control
                information. When they realize the full import of the Federal statutes, they will
                see that a change is inevitable. It is the job of the voters and the taxpayers to
                make Congress hurry up.” </p>
            <q who="NYT"><p>In <place>India</place>, <place>Burma</place> and <place>Malaya</place>,
                    as well as in the more modern communities of <place>England</place> and
                        <place>Japan</place>, the birth-control movement is making rapid headway,
                    Mrs. Sanger reported. </p>
                <p>While in India, she established fifty centers for teaching birth control and
                    gained the endorsement of the <org>All-India Women’s Conference</org>. </p></q>
