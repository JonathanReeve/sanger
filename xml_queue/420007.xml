		<head>WATCHFUL WAITING</head>
		<p>Forty thousand women belonging to the <org reg="Socialist Party">Socialist
				party of the <place>United States</place></org> wired their protest against the
			brutalities of the militia in <place>Colorado</place> to <person reg="Wilson, Woodrow"
				>President Wilson</person>.</p>
		<p>Forty thousand women! A splendid army this. An army of women supposed to represent the
			class spirit and class consciousness of America.</p>
		<p>Is there nothing more fitting to the occasion that these women can do, than protest?
			Words--ever and always words--words of protest, or words of petition, even when blood is
			being shed and lives are being extinguished by the murderous officials to whom they are
			protesting.</p>
		<p>Doubtless the gracious protest found itself amidst others in the waste basket. And
			rightly so, for as long as the present system can keep the working class
			petition-minded, the masters need have no fear of an uprising, and the social and
			industrial revolution will be far away.</p>
		<p>Women of the Socialist party! If there is no fighting spirit among you impelling
			initiative other than to imitate the gentle suffragists, then at least take your
			cue--follow the lead of those whom you would represent. The protests of the <org>Cigar
				Makers</org> and <org>Typographical Union</org> and the <org>Miners of
					<place>Wyoming</place></org> consisted in sending arms and ammunition to the
			striking miners of Colorado, and these are good enough examples of working-class
			solidarity for all to follow.</p>
		<p>When 40,000 women cannot follow up a protest by action, then truly it would appear that
			they have something other than their "<q who="MARKA">chains to lose</q>."</p>
