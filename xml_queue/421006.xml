		<head>LIBERTY SCORNED BY MRS. SANGER</head>
		<head type="sub">She Prefers Thirty Days on Island to Justices' Clemency Offer</head>
		<p>
			<q who="NYTR">Mrs. Margaret Sanger was confronted in the <org
					reg="New York State Court of Special Sessions">Court of Special Sessions</org>,
					<place reg="Brooklyn, NY">Brooklyn,</place> yesterday with the choice of
				spending thirty days on <org reg="Blackwell's Island Penitentiary">Blackwell's
					Island</org> or of promising hereafter to observe the law in her campaign for
				the legalization of birth control. She turned her back upon the offer made by
				Justices <person reg="Freschi, John J.">Freschi</person>, <person
					reg="O'Keefe, George">O'Keefe</person> and <person reg="Hermann, Moses"
					>Herman</person>, and replied calmly:</q>
		</p>
		<p> “I cannot respect the law as it stands to-day.” </p>
		<p>
			<q who="NYTR">Then she was sentenced for maintaining her birth control clinic at 45
				Amboy Street, Brooklyn, and left the courtroom to serve her time. She will not go on
				a hunger strike.</q>
		</p>
		<p> “So far as I am concerned,” <q who="NYTR">said Mrs. Sanger in <org
					reg="Raymond Street Jail">Raymond Street jail</org>,</q> “I have accomplished as
			much as is possible at this time. We have aroused public opinion and created an
			agitation which will bear fruit. I shall submit to finger-printing, if that is
			necessary, and I intend to obey all workhouse regulations. What do trifles like that
			matter when you are working for a great cause?</p>
		<p> “I am happier than if I had been acquitted. Expecting to be sentenced, I came all
			prepared.” <q who="NYTR">Mrs. Sanger then showed two books which are to be her
				companions for the next month-- '<title type="book">Julius Lavallon</title>,' by
					<person reg="Blackwood, Algernon">Algernon Blackwood</person>, and '<title
					type="book">Lessons in Truth</title>,' by <person reg="Cady, Harriet Emil">H.
					Emil Cady</person>.</q> “I intend to study prison conditions while I am in the
			workhouse and shall make a report upon my release,” Mrs. Sanger resumed. “It is also my
			intention to carry on my work not only after I am released, but while I am doing my
			bit.</p>
		<p> “It was impossible for me to accept the offer of the court to suspend sentence. I could
			not promise to give up my life work. You cannot change the color of your soul any more
			than the color of your eyes.” </p>
		<p><q who="NYTR">Before sentencing Mrs. Sanger, Justice Freschi said:</q> "<q who="FREJO">If
				you promise faithfully to obey the law in future this court will exercise extreme
				clemency.</q>" “I will promise to obey the law pending the appeal of my case to a
			higher court,” <q who="NYTR">Mrs. Sanger answered, later refusing to give an unqualified
				promise. </q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="NYTR">When Mrs. Sanger was led from the courtroom to the prison van she headed a
				procession of eight handcuffed men. As they were about to leave the building one of
				her friends rushed up with a cup of coffee, which she hurriedly swallowed. A bundle
				of sandwiches shoved into her hands by another friend, were distributed among the
				men prisoners. Miss <person reg="Mindell, Fania">Fannie Mindell</person>, who acted
				as interpreter at the Brownsville clinic, was fined $50. This was paid by Mrs.
					<person reg="Pinchot, Gertrude Minturn">Amos Pinchot</person> on behalf of the
					<org>Committee of One Hundred</org>.</q>
