		<head>LEGISLATION: CONFUSED AND TANGLED</head>
		<byline>By Margaret Sanger</byline>
		<p>For nearly sixty years, the federal laws on obscenity have held sway over our literature,
			art, science and medicine. These laws control the use of the U.S. Mails and all
			common-carriers including express companies. The Federal obscenity laws class prevention
			of conception and abortion with pornography, filth and indecency. Facts or knowledge
			concerning either of these two medical subjects do not belong there.</p>
		<p>First, let me emphasize that the prevention of conception is <emph rend="italics"
				>not</emph> abortion. It is not classed as indecent in other countries. It is not
			classed as indecent in many of our own states. A study of our state laws reveals
			this.</p>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">
				<emph rend="italics">Federal Laws</emph>
			</head>
			<p>The Federal law, <name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211"
					>Section 211</name> of the Penal Code was passed by <org
					reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> in 1873 at the end and on the last
				day and during the last hours of a hectic, hurried, confused session of Congress.
				The instigator of that law, <person reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony
					Comstock</person>, was as ignorant as he was fanatical. His idea was that
				everything relating to sex was obscene.</p>
			<p>The Federal laws make no exceptions in their prohibitions for literature of a
				scientific character. Nor have they made an exception for the physician in his
				regular practice, or for hospitals or clinics, or for patients of these hospitals or
				clinics, or for the general and proper distribution of medical supplies. These laws
				have been the means of suppressing properly authorized scientific literature on the
				subject of contraception because no publisher will jeopardize his freedom or risk
				his reputation in publishing books when there is a law against their
				circulation.</p>
			<p>These laws interfere with the importation of articles and of the results of research
				which is undertaken in other countries. Such data and such results of laboratory
				research would be of great assistance to the medical profession of this country in
				the proper functioning of their profession.</p>
			<p>They make it an offense subject to a penalty of five years in prison and $5,000 find
				for anyone to send through the U.S. Mails even the <emph rend="italics"
					>address</emph> of a physician, hospital, or birth control clinic stating <emph
					rend="italics">where</emph> contraceptive information may be obtained--this
				despite the fact that there are already laws in many states enabling physicians to
				give oral advice to patients in their regular practice, and there are in this
				country today over 80 legally operating birth control clinics distributed over 12
				states. These birth control clinics are medically established and medically
				directed, and have been organized solely for the purpose of giving contraceptive
				information by the medical profession.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">
				<emph rend="italics">State Laws</emph>
			</head>
			<p>The laws in the 48 states, while not so arbitrary, are nevertheless confusing, and
				many conflict with the Federal laws.</p>
			<p>1. Twenty-five states have obscenity laws which fortunately have <emph rend="italics"
					>not</emph> classed prevention of conception with abortion. Here physicians and
				medical centers, hospitals, welfare agencies could legally establish birth control
				clinics and instruct mothers in safe methods of contraception for economic and
				social reasons as well as for health. These states are<lb/>
				<place>Alabama</place>, <place>Arkansas</place>, <place>Delaware</place>,
					<place>Florida</place>, <place>Georgia</place>, <place>Illinois</place>,
					<place>Kentucky</place>, <place>Maryland</place>, <place>Nebraska</place>,
					<place>New Hampshire</place>, <place>New Mexico</place>, <place>North
					Carolina</place>, <place>North Dakota</place>, <place>Oklahoma</place>,
					<place>Oregon</place>, <place>Rhode Island</place>, <place>South
					Carolina</place>, <place>South Dakota</place>, <place>Tennessee</place>,
					<place>Texas</place>, <place>Utah</place>, <place>Vermont</place>,
					<place>Virginia</place>, <place>West Virginia</place> and
					<place>Wisconsin</place>.</p>
			<p>Many of the other states while including the term prevention of conception in the
				obscenity laws make some exceptions as to medical colleges, medical literature or
				medical practice. These states are<lb/>
				<place>Colorado</place>, <place>Indiana</place>, <place>Iowa</place>,
					<place>Ohio</place> and <place>Wyoming</place>.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, the Federal law would make it a crime for doctors or anyone else to
				send through the U.S. Mails such books or publications specifically exempt under the
				laws in these five states.</p>
			<p>2. Eight other states prohibit the publishing of any notice or advertisement or
				distribution of information or material to prevent conception. Oral information not
				prohibited. These are<lb/>
				<place>Arizona</place>, <place>California</place>, <place 
					>Idaho</place>, <place>Louisiana</place>, <place
					>Massachusetts</place>, <place>Montana</place>, <place 
					>Nevada</place> and <place>Washington</place>.</p>
			<p>3. Three states allow teaching of contraception in chartered medical colleges and
				publication of medical books, (but they do not mention practitioners of medicine).
				These are<lb/>
				<place>Kansas</place>, <place>Missouri</place> and <place 
					>Pennsylvania</place>.</p>
			<p>4. <place>New York</place> and <place>Minnesota</place> allow
				physicians to give information and prescriptions for supplies “<q who="CRAFR">for the
					cure and prevention of disease</q>.”</p>
			<p>5. <place >New Jersey</place> grants exemption to physicians who find a “<q
					who="UNK">just cause</q>” for advising and instructing patients.</p>
			<p>6. <place>Maine</place> and <place >Michigan</place> are two states
				prohibiting the publication and distribution of <emph rend="italics"
					>information</emph> (not material) relating to prevention of conception.</p>
			<p>7. <place >Mississippi</place> prohibits the publication of information or
				the giving of oral information relating to prevention of conception.</p>
			<p>8. Lastly and uniquely, the one state of <place>Connecticut</place> makes
				itself ridiculous by prohibiting the <emph rend="italics">use</emph> of any article
				which prevents conception.</p>
			<p>Hanging over all these tangled and confused laws is the Federal statue, Section 211
				of the Penal Code, which forbids the use of the mails to the doctors in those
				respective states where they are legally allowed to give advice in public or private
				practice.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, under the present laws, it is a crime for me to send a mother situated
				in any of these states the address of any clinic lawfully operating in that state,
				even though such an individual may be poverty stricken or diseased, and even though
				she may have a right under that state law to have this information for her health
				and for her family happiness.</p>
			<p>Over two generations have passed since the time that law was enacted. Women have
				gained suffrage; colleges and universities now teach scientific, biological facts of
				life to students; social hygiene is part of our educational program; yet, nothing
				has been done by the medical profession, the clergy, women’s clubs, etc., to take a
				dignified stand on cleaning up these archaic laws. <emph rend="italics">It was as a
					challenge to these laws that the Birth Control movement arose and it is to amend
					these laws that the <org>National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
						Control</org> was organized.</emph></p>
			<p>There is nothing to be gained by keeping on the statute books laws that are known to
				be inimical to personal health, family happiness and racial development. These
				laws have already done untold harm. It is time that we replaced them by social
				legislation befitting the twentieth century.</p>
