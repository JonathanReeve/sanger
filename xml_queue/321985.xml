			<head>What Is the Greatest Need Now in the Sex Life of the Nation?</head>
			<head type="sub">A Symposium</head>
			<byline>By Margaret Sanger</byline>
			<p> The greatest need in the sex life of <place reg="United States">the nation</place>
				is ADULT sex instruction.</p>
			<p> Volumes have been written on sex instruction for children while adults must flounder
				about for sane instruction or assume they know it all.</p>
			<p> Plain physiological facts are essential and necessary for adults. Each day brings me
				letters from hundreds of men and women showing the need for the simplest and
				plainest instruction about the sex functions.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="GVQ">(In the letter that accompanied this answer by Margaret Sanger, there
					is one sentence we cannot refrain from quoting,</q> “Of course I want laws
				changed; but ye gods! The plainest facts of life are unknown to millions of people;
				there is no sex vocabulary known because of colossal ignorance.” <q who="GVQ">-
					Asso. Ed.)</q>
