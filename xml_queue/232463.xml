		<p> On behalf of the officers of the <org reg="International Planned Parenthood Federation"
				>Int PPF</org> it is my pleasure to express our thanks to the addresses of welcome
			especially by the <person reg="Miki, Takeo">Minister</person> of Welfare of the
			Government of <place reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokyo</place> Metropolis.</p>
		<p>It is also my privilege to thank the <org reg="Family Planning Federation of Japan">F.P.
				Fed of Japan</org> for inviting us to come to <place reg="Japan">this charming
				country</place> &amp; hold our <org type="Conference"
				reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 5th">fifth Int Conference on
				BC</org> here in Tokyo. </p>
		<p>In my last years of experience I know a good deal about the organization of Conferences.
			I <supplied resp="MSPP">know</supplied> the importance of sweat &amp; tears, the
			headaches &amp; heartaches all of which combine to meld together strong bonds of minds
			&amp; hearts. These qualities have been evident for the past year by the Japanese
			Planning Committee. They have worked voluntarily, they each have had positions to hold
			during the regular eight hours &amp; conference work had to be done in after hours often
			late in the night.</p>
		<p>They have had no office, so secretary, little funds, a battered typewriter, and had to
			face all the primitive <supplied resp="MSPP">expedients</supplied> where only faith,
			love &amp; <emph rend="underline">caring</emph> spurred on their endeavors. Today you
			are to see the results which this courageous group has organized &amp; presented on
			paper.</p>
		<p>It is now the same qualities of faith &amp; love &amp; caring on our part as delegates to
			bring this into realization.</p>
		<p>It is a special joy to me that I do not have to make any special address as there are
			Scientists of various categories to tell you what I would like to say, it will be told
			from <add>the</add> experience of experts and will be of historical importance for our
			future civilization--</p>
		<p>Again may I thank you who have come from far away lands some at great Sacrifice to pool
			their ideas &amp; experiences. This week is to be a record breaker of high standing for
			quality of clear thinking &amp; frank discussion-- My gratitude the warmth of my hear
			that you are here. </p>
