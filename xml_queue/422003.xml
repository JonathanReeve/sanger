				<q who="CDT">The first result of the hunger strike and forcible feeding of <person

				<q who="CDT">A drive on <org reg="United States Congress">congress</org> Tuesday by

				<q who="CDT">Meanwhile Mrs. Byrne, hunger striking in protest against her conviction
					and imprisonment for disseminating birth control information, gave up her
					battle.</q>

			<p>
				<q who="CDT">It was not until Mrs. Byrne, having gone 108 hours without food or
					water, collapsed that <person reg="Lewis, Burdett G.">Commissioner
						Lewis</person> established a precedent in American prison annals by ordering
					her forcibly fed.</q>

			<p>"My sister," said Mrs. Margaret Sanger, leader of the birth control movement, "is in
				very critical condition since she was rolled in a blanket and milk, eggs and a
				stimulant forced into her stomach through a rubber tube.</p>
			<p>"As for helping my sister, we are balked at every turn. The women of the <org
					reg="Committee of 100">committee of one hundred,</org> Mrs. Fassett, <person
					reg="Pinchot, Gertrude Minturn">Mrs. Amos Pinchot</person> and others have therefore
				concentrated on getting favorable action by congress.</p>
			<p>"A canvas of congressmen will be made by Mrs. Fassett and the others and one of our
				friends chosen to introduce the proposed law.</p>
			<p>"The bill has not been completely drafted, but it will seek the nullification of the
				federal statute against the dissemination of birth control information and the
				establishment of the righ to tell poor women who need it, all about it."</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Explains "Hunger Strike."</head>

			<p><q who="CDT">Mrs. Sanger explained today that her sister is hunger striking</q>
				"against the action of the course in refusing her the right to test the
				constitutionality of the <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> anti-birth
				control law."</p>
			<p><q who="CDT">Describing it as</q> "the most outrageous piece of legislation on the
				statute books," Mrs. Sanger declared that it keeps poor working people in ignorance,
				while those with money and intelligence can get the forbidden information and use
				it.</p>
			<p>"Birth control is a new movement in this country," <q who="CDT">she said,</q> "and
				misunderstood. Its only object is to prevent the birth of more children than the
				parents can give good health, good minds, and a good chance to win the battle of
				life. It is not opposed to the birth rate, as such."</p>
