		<head>Advocate of Birth Control Praises Congressmen's Work</head>
		<head type="sub">Visitor Here Says Representatives Do As People Back Home Wish. </head>
		<p>
			<q who="DO">Praise for congressmen--of all things--came from the lips of Mrs. Margaret
				Sanger, international birth control advocate, on her visit to <place
					reg="Oklahoma City, OK">Oklahoma City</place> Wednesday.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="DO">With men even running for <org reg="United States Congress">congress</org>
				on a platform calling for the abolition of that division of government, Mrs. Sanger
				sounded a new note when she volunteered the observations that Oklahoma's
				representatives really are working at the job of representing their
				constituents.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="DO">And that coming from a woman who knows more about the antics of congress
				than <person reg="Winchell, Walter">Winchell</person> does of keyhole peeping is
				classed in this section as "something."</q>
		</p>
		<p>“It has been my observation that <place>Oklahoma</place> congressmen follow the dictates
			of their people back home. The fact that they even know what the desire of the people is
			becomes remarkable in itself, because those from the so-called ‘older sections’ don’t
			even know who their constituents are,” declared Sanger.</p>
		<p><q who="DO">On birth control, Mrs. Sanger’s study shows <place>Oklahoma</place> is
			</q>"rather indifferent."</p>
		<p>
			<q who="DO">The birth control exponent will speak Thursday at 11 a.m. in the Biltmore
				hotel before the Town Hall, sponsored by the Junior League.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"But you are going to see a change. Birth control is the one issue left this generation
			of youths, who have had everything done for them."</p>
		<p> "They settled woman’s suffrage for them, changed this law and that and with prohibition
			repeal voted, only the bewhiskered law against disseminating of birth control
			information on the statute books for 60 years, remains for them."</p>
		<p> “My correspondence from Oklahoma is interesting in that it shows the farm women, those
			in poorer circumstances, are becoming slowly interested and are apt to take a hand." </p>
		<p> “We worry about the farmer who is worrying about a crop failure and give him relief– yet
			the greatest worry, and none can challenge this statement, of the farm woman is
			pregnancy."</p>
		<p>“We aid the unemployed, realize that hundreds of thousands of them will never find work,
			will always be poor– and yet more and more children are being born into exactly those
			circumstances, with no more hope for them than the doomed of today,” <q who="DO">she
				declared.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="DO">With a smile that flashes brilliant and fades to reappear again, Mrs. Sanger
				quickly proves she is not a radical. Fanatics, whom she consider</q>
		</p>
		<p>“All I ask is an understanding. That is all I want to do in this visit. Getting a clear
			understanding will do much more than attempting to force any doctrines.” </p>
