		<div>
			<p>
				<q who="SD">Mrs. Margaret Sanger from <place reg="United States"
						>America</place>, one of Birth Control’s most zealous
					champions, the pioneer for improving the condition of
					American mothers and wives, is at present visiting in
					Stockholm before she continues a few days hence her study
					trip to <place reg="Soviet Union">Russia</place>. About a
					decade ago Mrs. Sanger opened the first <org
						reg="Brownsville Clinic">Birth Control Clinic</org> in
					America. This was then possible by the revised law in this
					respect in <place>New York</place>State. One desired
					objective for the entire United States for which Mrs. Sanger
					is working is the passage of the so-called Birth Control
					Bill. </q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="SD">This proposed law, which permits the dissemination
					of knowledge concerning birth control and methods of
					prevention through doctors, pharmacists and controlled
					clinics, lately came before the Senate. It went through--but
					only for five minutes. After this period one of the voters
					woke up--parenthesis, a representative of the <org
						reg="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</org>--and
					protested. Thus, Birth Control fell through that time. But
					Mrs. Sanger does not despair.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“Next year the law will pass,” <q who="SD">said Mrs. Sanger
					optimistically, when late Monday evening after an excursion
					to <place reg="Skansen, Sweden">Skansen</place> she placed
					herself at our disposal for an interview. </q>“We have
				worked for twenty years with faith and loyalty and some time our
				effort must bear fruit.”</p>
			<p>“The <name type="law"
					reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">present
					law</name> was introduced sixty years ago and nothing in it
				has been changed since that time. We are no striving to change
				it for the sake of the poor and burdened mother. If we have
				effective birth control,” <q who="SD">Mrs. Sanger continued
					optimistically,</q> “abortion will be unnecessary. What we
				wish to give mothers is a breathing space, so to speak, to give
				them at least a couple of years between each child. That can
				scarcely be too much to ask.” <q who="SD">In this connection
					Mrs. Sanger asserted that the highest mortality figures
					among mothers occurs in the U.S.</q></p>
			<p>“A couple of weeks ago,” <q who="SD">Mrs. Sanger stated
					further,</q> “a law was introduced in
				<place>England</place>according to which doctors and clinics not
				only have the right but are obliged to enlighten women who
				consult them concerning the existence of methods of protection
				and their use.” </p>
			<p>
				<q who="SD">Mrs. Sanger also developed her viewpoint on the
					subject of birth control in connection with the world’s
					peace problem. </q>
			</p>
			<p>“We all know how the countries have closed their doors to each
				other, how emigration and immigration have diminished or been
				made impossible. If a people with a great increase of population
				are denied the possibility of immigrating, the standard of
				living goes down and the country must embark upon an effective
				control of birth. Birth Control is, I believe, a fundamental
				measure against the over-population and war between countries,
				and the women especially should all support this measure warmly
				and heartily.” </p>
			<p>
				<q who="SD">The aim of Mrs. Sanger’s visit to Russia via our
					land is to study general health conditions and problems
					connected therewith, such as the capacity of women in
					different countries to combine home and work, etc. The East
					Indian women meet in a congress this year and naturally Mrs.
					Sanger has been asked to attend. </q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="SD">Mrs. Sanger is a simple and sweet woman with a
					friendly smile about her wise mouth. One senses nothing
					about her of the suffrage woman and dictator, and yet as
					such a one must she still be regarded. Mrs. Sanger was born
					of Irish parents but came to American rather early where as
					a nurse in <place reg="New York, NY">New York
					City</place>she obtained an insight into the distressing
					lives of the working women. It was sympathy with her
					suffering sisters and the wish to lessen their burden which
					later dictated her actions. She contrived by and by, after a
					various number of reverses, among other a sojourn in prison,
					to bring about a <org
						reg="International Neo-Malthusian and Birth Control Conference, 6th"
						>Birth Control Congress</org>in America, and a few years
					later she was present as a source of inspiration at the <org
						reg="World Population Conference, 1927">World Population
						Conference</org> in <place reg="Geneva, Switzerland"
						>Geneva</place>. Assiduous studies of European
					conditions had, on her part, preceded this conference. At
					the present time Mrs. Sanger is the director of a <org
						reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">Birth
						Control Clinic</org> in New York. It was the first of
					its kind but since then, hundreds have been established in
					imitation of it.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="SD"><org reg="Stockholm Women's Club">The Women's Club</org> in Stockholm has planned a
					luncheon at <place reg="Moseback, Sweden">Moseback</place>
					on Wednesday for the American visitor. </q>
