		<head>EDITORIAL COMMENT</head>
		<p><person reg="Stelk, John">Judge John Stelk,</person> of the <org
				reg="Chicago Court of Domestic Relations">Court of Domestic Relations,</org>
			<place reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago,</place> has issued a report of his work in which he
			proves himself to be a genuine humanitarian and an exceptionally enlightened jurist. He
			advocates birth control, handles without gloves the war baby problem and scores the
			hypocrisy and inefficiency of organized charity. The poor, overburdened mother has the
			right, he affirms, to "<q who="STEJO">guard against another mouth to feed</q>." The same
			knowledge that is "<q who="STEJO">given out every day to her sisters in the higher walks
				of life</q>" should be extended to her. "<q who="STEJO">I don't hesitate to
			say,</q>" he declares, "<q who="STEJO">that it is a thing of sheer brutality to compel a
				physically debilitated wife to further burden herself and society with defective
				offspring, aside from the almost criminal shortcomings, with attendant misery,
				visited upon the latter. I am of the opinion that some day the entire question will
				be considered by the <org reg="United States Government">Federal
				Government.</org></q>" So far as we know, he drew his conclusions directly from the
			problems he was called upon to solve in the Court of Domestic Relations. We regard it as
			only a matter of time before all thinking persons with the interests of society at heart
			will hold similar views. But it is gratifying to find a judge in the vanguard of
			progress, usually men of his calling are among the last to fall in line. We shall have
			more to say about Mr. Stelk, of Chicago, in a subsequent issue.</p>
		<p>WORD HAS COME that Dr. <person reg="Reitman, Ben">Ben Reitman</person> has lost his
			appeal in the higher courts of <place>Ohio</place>. He was first tried about a year ago
			and convicted of giving out birth control leaflets. His sentence, now affirmed, was six
			months in the workhouse and a fine of $1,000. <place reg="Cleveland, OH"
				>Cleveland</place> newspapers state that he began to serve this outrageous jail term
			on March 18. It is to be regretted that no mention was made of his case in the report of
			the <org reg="Ohio Birth Control League">Cleveland league</org> printed elsewhere in
			this issue. Dr. Reitman does not appear to have received the full local support to which
			any idealist battling in this cause was surely entitled.</p>
		<p>Official <place>France</place> is crying for more children to fill the places of those
			who have been slain. But the people, militarized and stricken economically, are unable
			properly to care for all those who come into the world as it is. Let two incidents
			recorded in recent <place reg="Paris, France">Paris</place> newspapers demonstrate the
			point. <person reg="Maffert, Louis">Louis Maffert,</person> one of the editors of the
			patriotic <title type="journal"><foreign lang="FRE">La Victoire,</foreign></title>
			writes as follows. "<q who="MAFLO">We are certainly too fond of formulas. When we
				discover a phrase which is applicable to a problem, we repeat it with unwearied
				zeal. We say sanctiomoniously to every woman 'Have children!' and the day before
				yesterday two poor girl-mothers arrived at my office, at nine o'clock in the
				evening, with two new-born infants. They were without food, without money, without
				shoes and without lodging. The hotels never seem to have rooms for unfortunates of
				their kind. We did our best for them and finally turned them over to the <org
					reg="Saint Sulpice H&ocirc;tel">Saint Sulpice home</org>. But, all the same,
				such things ought not to happen.</q>" Again, the Socialist newspaper, <title
				type="journal"><foreign lang="FRE">l'Humanite,</foreign></title> tells how a father,
			mother and four young children, unable to meet their obligations, were dispossessed in
			mid-winter not by a flinty-hearted bourgeois landlord, but by a munitions concern
			controlled by the <org reg="French Ministry of War">Ministry of War</org>, on whose
			property their poor lodging was located. Had the parents practiced birth control, the
			repopulation of France would have suffered, but they probably would have been
			financially able to cope with their ironical tragedy.</p>
		<p>We wish that we had available space in this magazine to record every case of wife murder
			and infanticide occurring as a result of unrestricted childbearing. Every month sees
			scores of such tragedies in the <place>United States</place>, only a small proportion of
			which are considered sufficiently sensational to be played up in the newspapers. Of the
			thousands that take place in other countries we, of course, hear nothing. We have before
			us accounts of two incidents which illustrate the extremes of the problem. The birth of
			a seventh child in a poverty-stricken Italian home in <place reg="New York, NY">New York
				City</place> rendered the <person reg="Unidentified">father</person> temporarily
			insane. He stamped up and down the room where his wife was lying in bed, muttering in
			his despair, then drew a knife and stabbed at the baby. The mother threw herself across
			the little body and received a mortal wound. Horrified the man fled. In a <place>New
				Jersey</place> suburb of Greater New York, a <person reg="Unidenitifed">middle-aged
				mother</person> with a boy of sixteen and a girl of eleven gave birth to a third
			girl. This was an eventuality which she had plainly not figured upon. She brooded until
			her mind was affected. With a small quantity of chloroform bought at the drug store, she
			ended her baby's life. When placed under arrest, she stated that she had felt herself
				"<q who="UNK">unable to raise the child properly</q>," that her everyday domestic
			work had become too formidable for her to cope with. Can any one doubt that this was a
			case of unwanted pregnancy? By every dictate of reason, knowledge of how to prevent
			conception should have been available for her, no less than for the murdered Italian
			mother with her seven babies produced in blindness and ignorance and probably in all too
			rapid succession to each other.</p>
		<p>We call attention to the prospectus on another page of <org>The New York Woman's
				Publishing Company</org>, Inc. This new organization is composed of fifteen women,
			who propose to leave no stone unturned to put The <title type="journal">Birth Control
				Review</title> on a financial basis. Application for papers of incorporation has
			been made, and $10,000 worth of stock will be offered to the public at $10 a share.</p>
		<p>When this magazine resumed publication last December, we printed an appeal for help and
			told our subscribers that the continued existence of the only organ of the birth control
			movement in America depended upon their cooperation. The response was almost nil, but we
			have struggled along through the winter at a financial loss. The little group that has
			borne the burden cannot do so indefinitely. If YOU want your magazine to live, buy at
			least one share and urge your friends to do likewise. It is a case of now or never.</p>
