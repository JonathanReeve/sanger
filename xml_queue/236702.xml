		<p>Christianity has drawn us into world affair. We <emph rend="underline">are</emph> our
			brothers keeper</p>
		<p>We will in 200 years increase to 2,000 million</p>
		<p>Who shall inhabit our land--</p>
		<p>Main essential question is one of understanding-- We can not go forward in peace &amp;
			prosperity alone</p>
		<p>No splendid isolation for us spiritually</p>
		<p>We will have to go back &amp; mark time until all nations emerge same point of

		<p>Membership--</p>
		<p>Past year Japanese officials coming to USA reported intent in birth control in <place
				reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokio</place></p>
		<p><org reg="United States Department of Interior">Department of Interior</org> sent 25
			copies around world</p>
		<p>Two groups in Japan-- Conservative old--young progressive</p>
		<p>Western civilization has invaded Japan</p>
		<p>bringing our life saving clinics, sanitation, hygiene, surgery, charities, &amp;
			philanthropy</p>
		<p>rescuing sick, feeble and diseased making their problems more complex</p>
		<p>She can no longer resort to nature -- cruel methods of reducing these populations by
			disease &amp; famine</p>
		<p>She has gone beyond that, as have we of the Western Countries -- we must reach out to
			science to help us. That science is Birth Control.</p>
		<p>Japan has a population of 56 million people </p>
		<p>Within an area no larger than California</p>
		<p>Half the population of the whole of USA</p>
		<p>She has a survival rate of an increasing number of inhabitants to the number of 700,000
			to 1 million a year</p>
		<p>This far exceeds that of any other country</p>
		<p>The militarists want 100,000 million for Japan to become a world power</p>
		<p>For Japan to win more territory she must have the natural right--which is an
			expanding right, for her growing population</p>
		<p>During the past 65 years Japans population has doubled--so have her problems</p>
		<p>The density of population of 320 to a sq mile</p>
		<p>Relief by emigration -- like <place>Germany</place>--experts education no return to
			government</p>
		<p>Build up for war on B.C. today. American <unclear>hoggishness</unclear>--</p>
		<p>Younger element want b.c.</p>
		<p>Baroness Ishimoto--</p>
		<p>Pivot of future peace--pivot of international problem--</p>
		<p>We are drawn into international affairs--</p>
		<p>Whole world like child--</p>
		<p>We can not go far forward alone--</p>
		<p>International B.C. <place>France</place> -- Germany</p>
		<p>USA 200 years 2,000 million</p>
		<p>Intelligence viz reproduction</p>
		<p>Western Civilization invading Japan</p>
		<p>70,000,000 with 700,000 each year</p>
		<p>large as California--</p>
		<p>depended upon nature, floods, <unclear>famine</unclear> infant mortality--</p>
		<p>Now hygiene &amp; sanitation resources rescues inhabitants &amp; makes problems of
			existence more complex</p>
		<p>Every relief obtained by emigration stimulates the birth rate or survival rate &amp;
			congestion sets in the and whole process is repeated</p>
