		<p>Western Civilization invaded <place>Japan</place></p>
		<p>sanitation, hygiene, surgery, inventions--doubles population, 50 years--problems more

		<p>Natures ways no longer possible--famine &amp; disease reduce population. Either

		<p>Population about 60 million area of <place>California</place>--5/6 mountainous--</p>

		<p>Militarists want 100 million--to strike for territory natural rights--</p>

		<p>War in 25 years or B.C. today</p>
		<p>Christianity has drawn us into world affairs. We <emph rend="underline">are</emph> our
			brothers keeper.</p>
		<p>We will in 200 years increase to 2,000 millions who shall inhabit our land--</p>
		<p>Main essential question is one of understanding-- We can not go forward in peace &amp;
			prosperity alone. No splendid isolation for us spiritually. We will have to go back
			&amp; mark time until all nations emerge same point of understanding &amp; join hands on
			the march to the brotherhood of man &amp; human liberation. </p>
		<p>Penn laws-- League--<org reg="American Birth Control League">ABC.
			League</org>--Membership--</p>
		<p>Past year Japanese officials coming to U.S.A. reported interest in birth control in
				<place reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokio</place>.</p>
		<p><org reg="United States Department of Interior">Department of Interior</org> sent 25
			repres around world.</p>
		<p>Two groups in Japan-- Conservative old--young progressive.</p>
		<p>Western civilization <emph rend="underline">has invaded</emph> Japan by bringing our life
			saving clinics, <emph rend="underline">sanitation</emph>, <emph rend="underline"
				>hygiene</emph>, Surgery, <emph rend="underline">Charities</emph>, &amp; <emph
				rend="underline">philanthropy</emph>, rescuing sick, <emph rend="underline"
				>feeble</emph> &amp; diseased making their <emph rend="underline">problems</emph>
			more <emph rend="underline">complex</emph>.</p>
		<p>She can no longer resort to nature or cruel methods of reducing her population by disease
			&amp; famine.</p>
		<p><emph rend="underline">She has gone beyond that</emph>, as have we of the Western
			Countries-- We must reach out to Science to help us. <emph rend="underline">That science
				is Birth Control</emph>.</p>
		<p>Japan has a population of 56 million people with an area no larger than
				<place>California</place> half the population of the whole of USA. She has a
			survival rate or an increasing number of inhabitants to the number of 700,000 to 1
			million a year.</p>
		<p>This far exceeds that of any other country. The militarists want 100,000 million for Japan to become a world power.</p>
		<p>For Japan to win more territory she must have the natural right--which is an expanding
			right for her growing population.</p>
		<p>During the past 65 years Japans population has doubled--so have her problems. The density of population of 320 to a sq mile.</p>
		<p><emph rend="underline">Relief</emph> by emigration--like <place>Germany</place>--experts education no return to
			government. Build up for war or B.C. today.</p> <p>American hoggishness--younger element want b.c.</p>
		<p>Baroness Ishimoto--</p>
		<p>Pivot of future peace--pivot of international problem--</p>
		<p>We are drawn into International affairs-- Whole world like child-- We can not go far forward alone-- International B.C. <place>France</place>--Germany
U.S.A. 200 years 2,000 million.</p>
		<p>Intelligence viz reproduction</p>
		<p>Western Civilization invading Japan 70,000,000 with 700,000 each year large as California--depended upon nature, floods, fam. infant mortality--</p>
		<p>Now hygiene &amp; sanitation resources rescues inhabitants &amp; makes problem of
			existence more complex</p>
		<p>Every relief obtained by emigration stimulates the birth rate or survival rate &amp;
			congestion sets in &amp; the whole process is repeated</p>
