		<head>Mr. Gandhi's Views on Birth Control</head>
		<head type="sub">DISCUSSION WITH MRS. SANGER</head>
		
		<p><q who="ToI"> The details of a conversation between <person
					reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K. ">Mr. Gandhi</person> and Mrs.
				Sanger on the subject of birth control were disclosed at a
				select gathering in Bombay on Sunday evening. The occasion was a
				tea party given at the Taj Mahal Hotel by the Society for the
				Study and Promotion of Family Hygiene to Mrs. Margaret Sanger,
				who recently returned to Bombay after a tour during which she met Mr.
				Gandhi.</q> </p>
		
		<p><q who="ToI">Mr. Gandhi, Mrs. Sanger said, agreed with her on all
				points in regard to birth control except the methods of adopting
				it. The question when she went to him was whether she would
				convert him or he would convert her. </q>“And believe me,”<q who="ToI"> she
			added, </q>“he did not convert me.” (Laughter). </p>
		<p>
			<q who="ToI">“But was he converted?” asked a voice.</q>
		</p>
		<p>“I do not know,” <q who="ToI">replied Mrs. Sanger. </q></p>
		
		<p><q who="ToI">Mr. Gandhi, the lecturer continued, agreed with her that birth
				control was an important question, but he, like many other
				people, believed that "<emph rend="italics">control</emph>" was
				a wide term and that it meant something more than limitation.
				The method which Mr. Gandhi advocated was continence and
				restraint, not only outside marriage but in marriage also.</q> </p>
		<p><q who="ToI"> Mrs. Sanger continued that she had asked Mr. Gandhi whether he
				considered that a practical solution, knowing that of all the
				women in the world Indian women were less equipped economically
				and socially to go out into the world. He had replied that they
				could have divorce laws. </q></p>

			<p><q who="ToI">Mrs. Sanger further said:</q> “I told him ‘all this sounds rather
				chaotic to me, and I believe the men will be on my side. Men
				would prefer the methods of birth control that I advocate rather
				than yours’. He said: <q who="GANMO">‘Women will be on my side.’
				</q>(Laughter). We have yet to find out of that will be so,”
				<q who="ToI">added Mrs. Sanger.</q> </p>
			
			<p><q who="ToI"> Before she came to <place>India</place>, Mrs. Sanger said,
					she had been told that she was not likely to succeed in her
					mission because Indian mothers were fond of children and
					liked to have many, irrespective of what she state of their
					(mothers’) health was. On questioning mothers during their
					visits to slums in Bombay and in northern India, however,
					she had invariably got the reply that they had had enough
					children and wanted no more. They were anxious to have some
					means by which they could space their children. </q></p>
			<p><q who="ToI"> Mrs. How-Martyn, who was present at the gathering, stated
					that those working on behalf of birth control in India had
					an advantage over their colleagues in the West, as they
					could have the benefit of the experience of the latter. </q></p>
			<p> <q who="ToI">A silver casket was presented to Mrs. Sanger, who has been
					elected vice-president of the Society, by Lt.-Col. <person
						reg="Shah, Jelal M.">Jelal M. Shah</person>, on behalf
					of the editor of <title type="journal">Marriage
						Hygiene</title>.</q> </p>
			<p> <q who="ToI">Lt.-Col. S. S. Sokhey, the chairman of the Council of the
					Society, proposed a vote of thanks to Mrs. Sanger.</q> </p>
