		<head>WOMAN REBEL SCORES ROOSEVELT AS ENSLAVER OF MOTHERS IN U.S.</head>
		<byline>(By FRANCES WAYNE.)</byline>
		<p>"<person reg="Roosevelt, Theodore">Colonel Roosevelt,</person> whose specialty is
			Americanism, has done more to enslave the women of <place reg="United States"
				>America</place> and to cheat the children of America than any other man or
			organization in the country has done."</p>
		<p>
			<q who="DP">This opinion of the leader of the <org reg="Progressive Party">Progressive
					party</org> was expressed by Margaret Sanger, who has come to <place
					reg="Denver, CO">Denver</place> on her tour of the cities of the country to
				deliver a lecture on "<title type="article">Birth Control</title>" at <org
					reg="Marble Hall">Marble hall</org> tomorrow evening.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="DP">"The "woman rebel," as Mrs. Sanger is called and known, sat in a high-backed
				chair in her room at the <org>Shirley hotel</org> this morning, looking like a
				picture of a demure, ultra-feminine gentlewoman more interested in darning socks
				than defying the government.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="DP">Mrs. Sanger is slight, with a face of peculiar brightness, due perhaps to
				the whiteness of her complexion, the sparkles of dark brown eyes and the shadowy
				quality of her black hair.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="DP">When she left the usual path in which the women of her class are ordained to
				walk by custom and tradition, Margaret Sanger chose the work of a nurse-a nurse to
				the pitiful women of the slums of <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> who
				year by year add one more to the city's mass of hopeless human beings who are heirs
				of poverty.</q>
		</p>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">PREACHES BOLD DOCTRINE AND DEFIES AUTHORITIES</head>
			<p>
				<q who="DP">The helplessness of these women drove the iron of courage into Margaret
					Sanger's soul and sent her forth to preach the bold doctrine that women who have
					nothing to give these children must cease having them.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="DP">To reach the public, Mrs. Sanger started a paper and named it the <title
						type="journal" reg="The Woman Rebel">Woman Rebel</title>. Deliberately she published statements
					which the Comstockian authorities held were a defiance of the federal law
					pertaining to obscenity.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="DP">Returning from a trip to <place>England</place>, Margaret Sanger was
					arrested by federal officers and brought to trial.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"My trial brought the over-burdened women of America clamoring about the court and
				the judge ordered an acquittal.</p>
			<p>"It is such a foolish law and such foolish people as Roosevelt that are responsible
				for the overcrowding of our home for mental defectives; that insure tenants for our
				insane asylums, prisons and alms' houses, because, when a man of Colonel Roosevelt's
				personality and influence begins to talk, people, especially women, listen."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="DP">Being opposed to the methods whereby Roosevelt encourages large
					families, willy-nilly, Margaret Sanger is also opposed to the methods resorted
					to by <person reg="Goldman, Emma">Emma Goldman</person> in her birth control
					propaganda.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"The subject about which I speak is a sacred one and to have effective results must
				be treated scientifically and with dignity, delicacy, and tact.</p>
			<p>"If I can't raise the subject of 'better babies or no babies' out of the muck I will
				take my bag and go back to nursing.</p>
			<p>"Education is, of course, the thing we are after. The large amount of talk on
				eugenics that we have heard doesn't reach far enough: it doesn't get to the poor at
				all and leaves the better classes merely cynical.</p>
			<p>"You know," she said with a smile, "I preach that the child who comes to the home of
				the rich an unwanted being is as bad off as the child who comes to the overcrowded
				hovels of the thoughtless poor.</p>
			<p>"What we need in this country are babies that are wanted and for whom there is not
				only a present but a future.</p>
			<p>"We do not overlook the fact that many children of poor parents have grown out of
				their poverty and escaped its blight to become useful citizens. But they have had
				something to start with: health, fresh air, good blood. They haven't been huddled in
				tenements and fed on husks. They have been born where there is room to play."</p>
			<p><q who="DP">In her speaking itinerary, Mrs. Sanger has had varying degrees of
					success. In <place reg="Akron, OH">Akron, Ohio,</place> the police said,</q>
				"nothing doing." In <place reg="St. Louis, MO">St. Louis,</place> a meeting at the
				fashionable <org reg="St. Louis City Club">City club</org> was crowded to the doors,
				and in <place reg="Indianapolis, IN">Indianapolis</place> she shared honors with
					<person reg="Osborn, Thomas Mott">Thomas Mott Osborn</person> in the largest
				meeting in the <org reg="National Conference of Charities and Correction">convention
					of National Charities and Corrections.</org></p>
