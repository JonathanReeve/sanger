		<div type="section">
			<p><q who="SFE">Two radical proposals to check “human erosion” in
					the nation were urged upon the government tonight by Mrs.
					Margaret Sanger, birth control advocate, in an interview
					here.</q></p>
			<p>
				<q who="SFE">Mrs. Sanger recommended:</q></p>
			<p><q who="SFE">
					<list>
						<item>1- Pensions for persons of child-bearing age with
							transmissible or hereditary diseases who will agree
							to sterilization, and: </item>
						<item>2 - Subsidies for healthy young men and woman,
							skilled artists, professionals and agriculturists
							who would welcome children, to tide them over the
							trying early years of married life until they can
							become self-supporting.</item>
					</list></q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Provisions Urged.</head>
			<p>
				<q who="SFE">Pointing out that the <org
						reg="United States Government">Federal Government</org>
					would seen he asked to appropriate $850.000,000 for
					improvement of the public health, Mrs. Sanger said that no
					doubt much of this sum required of the taxpayers would be
					sought to increase existing health and welfare services for
					mothers and children.</q>
			</p>
			<p><q who="SFE">So in addition to her other proposals she
					recommended that</q> “the men and women who have the welfare
				of this country at heart” <q who="SFE"> urge their
					representatives in <org reg="United States Congress"
						>Congress</org> to see that provision is also made for
					the Government to supply birth control information to
					parents</q> “among that enormous group of 20,000,000
				individuals dependant upon some form of public aid.” </p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Constructive Relief.</head>
			<p>“Such a measure,” <q who="SFE">she said,</q> “not only will give
				constructive, immediate relief to millions of families and
				prevent additional suffering, but would be he greatest forward
				step ever taken on a national scale to raise the level of
				intelligence of the nation’s population, and the quality of
				life.”</p>
			<p>
				<q who="SFE">Stressing the need for such government aid, Mrs.
					Sanger said that of the 2,000,000 babies born in this
					country in 1937, 1,100,000 were born to parents on relief or
					with incomes of less than $18 a week.</q>
			</p>
			<p><q who="SFE">Mrs. Sanger, director of the Birth Control Clinical
					Research Bureau here and author of "Margaret Sanger: an
					Autobiography," just returned from a trip south, where she
					said she found a great demand for birth control information
					among officials and others doing social work in "blighted"
					areas.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Aid to Marriage</head>
			<p><q who="SFE">Of her two proposals Mrs. Sanger said:</q></p>
			<p>"The cost of maintaining our derelict population is nothing
				compared to the loss of creative effort which might be utilized
				in other channels. Why should our benevolent Federal Government
				not make a constructive investment in the quality of our future
				citizenship by offering pensions to all those in the
				child-bearing aged with transmissible or hereditary diseases who
				will agree to sterilization?"</p>
			<p> "Here truly is a system of pensioning that would bring its own
				reward.</p>
			<p>“Couple with this another appropriation as an aid to marriage for
				those healthy, intelligent young men and women, skilled
				artisans, professionals, agriculturalists, who wish to marry and
				would welcome a family, if there were some provision to tide
				through possible emergencies in the first years until they could
				become entirely self-supporting.”</p>
