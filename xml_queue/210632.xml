		<salute>To the Readers of <title type="journal">THE BIRTH CONTROL REVIEW</title>:</salute>
		<p>The average tourist visiting <place>China</place>, cannot help but be impressed by the
			fact that the Malthusian doctrine has proven itself true here and can never be refuted
			while China exists in its present condition. Here one sees millions of people, with
			scarcely clothing enough to cover their naked bodies, eking out a mere existence for
			which they have to work twelve to twenty hours a day.</p>
		<p>On the way from <place reg="Shenwang, China">Mukden</place> to <place reg="Peking, China"
				>Peking</place>, every inch of ground is utilized for food. While on our trip from
			Peking to <place reg="Hankow, China">Hankow</place> and then down the Yangtze River to
				<place reg="Nanjing, China">Nanking </place>on our way to <place
				reg="Shanghai, China">Shanghai</place> we saw the land so taken up in producing food
			that the people are compelled to make their habitation and homes in boats upon the
			water. There are few roads in China. Even that space is taken over for food production
			and mile upon mile of great tracts of land is cultivated for the barest necessities, and
			this after four thousand years of civilization!</p>
		<p>China proves beyond a doubt that the bare fact of birth does not necessarily enhance our
			civilization. We find in this old country conditions that are appalling. In all the
			large cities the foreign quarters are clean and well cared for, with paved streets,
			beautiful palatial residences, few children in the districts, and those few well clothed
			and looked after by Chinese nurses. While off in another part of the city, where the
			Chinese native dwells, conditions are unspeakable. It amazes me that foreigners,
			Americans, English and French can live here and close their eyes to such sordid,
			degrading conditions. They could not live amongst such conditions in their own country
			without an effort to improve them. It is said by those who have lived here long, that
			China psychologically swallows up all those who live here, and I certainly believe that
			is true, for during my conversation with many missionaries and business people, who have
			lived here for the last fifteen or twenty years, I find that they have lost many of
			those qualities of character and conscientiousness which have been bred in them for
			generations in their own country. Here and there one finds an effort towards
			improvements, but the improvements in the cities are done mainly in the foreign
			districts for their own comfort and convenience. Here we see the most abject and
			distressing objects of poverty and misery. We see disease rampant openly in the streets.
			We see lepers sitting begging from passerby, while those afflicted with syphilitic sores
			walk beside us. We see mothers, professional beggars, who bear their children openly in
			the streets. Their children in turn become beggars and so it goes from generation to
			generation. The street is their home, eating sleeping, and begging there. They do not
			like to be photographed as if they are very superstitious and believe the camera brings
			evil to them.</p>
		<p>The thing I cannot accustom myself to in China, is being pulled in a rickshaw by a human
			being, or being carried in a sedan chair by three or four of them. I can't endure the
			eager running of the half naked rickshaw boy, and I avoid them whenever it is possible.
			It is said his days are numbered. He lives four or five years at most. The reminder of
			his life is spend eking out an existence. He suffers from varicose veins and heart
			disease. We see them everywhere, clothed in thin trousers and jacket, and usually ragged
			and dirty when not engaged by hotels. Eagerly they solicit our trade and pick up the
			shafts of their little vehicle and being the dog trot journey.</p>
		<p>At Peking a young women, secretary to a prominent official called for me to take me to
			the gentlemen's home. On the way she related the joys of living in China. She said she
			got a smaller salary, far smaller than she got in America, but her comforts far exceeded
			anything she could have at home with double her present wage. Among the comforts noted
			was a rickshaw boy whom she employed by the month, paying him 19 Mex. Or 5 American
			dollars a month, out of which the boy supports himself and his family. He had been in
			her employ three years--and she had never given him more money nor did she expect
			to.</p>
		<p>One of the hardest features of life of an employee in China is that he can not get a
			position by himself. He must have someone else get it for him. When a foreigner does not
			know this, and dismisses a servant, it means practical starvation for that man.</p>
		<p>Besides the rickshaw men, the lives of coolies and sing-song girls make me shudder. While
			in the Northern cities the coolies are men and boys, in <place reg="Hong Kong"
				>Hong kong</place> the women do this beast of burden work. As I sit writing this I
			look out of my window upon a newly built structure where hundreds of women are carrying
			bricks in baskets to the men who are laying them.</p>
		<p>I can not give here all my experiences, but I can never again boast of our civilization
			after my conversation with some of Shanghai's sing-song girls--these little children are
			segregated in districts for someone's profit. They are babies in body and mind, and are
			sold into bondage often in infancy. It is said they are owned completely by the woman or
			man in charge, and any attempt to run away or at insubordination is promptly met by the
			cruelest beatings and torture.</p>
		<p>I passed through several of these districts in Shanghai accompanied by a progressive
			missionary who had lived in China the past seventeen years. He spoke the language
			fluently and himself was an officer of the Door of Hope.</p>
		<p>I wanted particularly to find out what these girls used to prevent conception. They spoke
			freely of their lives and their sorrows. I came away sick to my soul with doubts and
			pity and would have been filled with despair had not each girl told the story of many
			babies at home, "<q who="UNK">too much baby</q>," "<q who="UNK">no chow</q>," convincing
			truth again and again that Birth Control is the basic solution to such problems,
			especially as they relate to the future.</p>
		<p>We in the Western world who have the desire to make the Birth Control movement
			international have asked ourselves how this idea would be accepted in the Orient. We
			have time and again been told by our opponents that the Japanese and Chinese would not
			accept this idea, and that eventually, if we persisted in our work in the western
			countries, the white race would be entirely wiped out. It is, however, a great pleasure
			to me to be able to say that the idea of Birth Control is readily accepted in both of
			these countries. I have already given an account of the enthusiasm with which the
			message was received in Japan, and, while there has been no such publicity in China, yet
			wherever I have gone, and there has been an opportunity to speak, the enthusiasm has
			been keen and encouraging. In Shanghai I was able to meet several members of the
				<org>Commercial Press</org>. All these gentlemen were editors and influential
			writers in the Chinese world. They entertained me at tea one afternoon and made plans
			for the translation and publication of a pamphlet on "<title type="book">Family
				Limitation</title>" and also for the establishment of a magazine devoted especially
			to the population and Birth Control subject. On Sunday April 30th I was invited to
			address a meeting at the <org>Labour Museum</org> on behalf of three organizations,
				<org>Kiangsu Educational Association</org>, the <org>National Association of
				Vocational Education of China</org> and the <org reg="Jiating Rixin Hui">Association
				of Family Reformation of China</org>. I was asked to address this public meeting, to
			consist of working men and women. It was interesting that the occasion of this meeting
			was the third anniversary of the Family Reformation Association of China. The three
			essential rules that one must abide by in joining this association are not to drink, not
			to smoke, and not to gamble. I suggested a fourth rule of limiting the family, to cope
			with the mothers' health and the fathers' income, and the suggestion was readily
			applauded.</p>
		<p>While my tour through China has not had the same national interest as my meetings in
				<place>Japan</place>, yet I feel that considering the lack of time and preparation
			for my coming to China the results have been splendid. With the possibility of a League
			in Peking and the establishment of a clinic there together with a branch League in
			Shanghai and a magazine devoted to Birth Control, I feel that we have established some
			good centres and should make rapid progress in the next few years. The Chinese press has
			been splendid. Wherever one has been able to arouse attention, there has been a splendid
			response and I feel that one of the important things of the future will be to send two
			or three speakers into China to remain at least six months, in order to pick up the
			loose ends and to encourage those already starting this work.</p>
		<p>From the <title type="journal">South China Morning Post</title> of May 8th in the
			Editorial entitled <title type="article">Birth Control</title> I quote: "<q who="SCMP"
				>China is as striking an example of over-population and resultant degeneration as
				the world can show. It might with difficulty be made the reformer's first battle
				ground, for from what we know of "ole custom" it would be a hard fight, so hard that
				if it were won, the education of the rest of the world would be a simple
			matter</q>."</p>
		<p>This sums the matter up in a nut-shell and yet I feel today, as I am about to leave this
			country for <place>Europe</place>, that there are no more encouraging prospects for the
			general practice of the idea than right here in China.</p>
