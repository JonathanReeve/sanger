		<p>Ever since the end of the war with <place>Japan</place>--there have been <del>requests
				&amp;</del> invitations from several organizations in Japan requesting me to come to
			Japan &amp; help set up an adequate organization on teaching &amp; technique of
			contraception to enable the poorest parents in that country to space pregnancies &amp;
			control the size of the family. One of the most prominent women in Japan Mrs. <person
				reg="Kato, Shidzue Ishimoto">Shizue Kato</person> a long time friend in <place
				reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokyo</place> made a special request <del>&amp; I according</del>
			and at no cost to the Occupying Authorities I was to be her guest.</p>
		<p>Previous to my application for a permit Gen <person reg="MacArthur, Douglas">Mc
				Arthur</person> on July 6, 1949 had announced that the subject of birth control or
			the pros or cons of the subject did not fall within the prescribed scope of the
			Occupation” He announced a “<q who="MACDO">hands off policy</q>” as he rightly
			considered it to be a subject for the Japanese people themselves to decide according to
			this sane &amp; right policy (Democratic)</p>
		<p>I sent an application on Aug 30 1949 to the <del>Military</del>
			<org reg="United States Pacific Military Permit Branch">Pacific Military Permit
				Branch</org> in <place reg="Washington, DC">Wsh DC</place>. Received a reply Aug 30
			that my request could not have favorable consideration On Sept 10th I wrote again
			requesting that my application be given further consideration because of the health
			factors involved in the large number of abortions now practiced by the desperate women
			in Japan--</p>
		<p>A further reconsideration was suggested after 2 months. On Nov 22 a reply came that the
				<org reg="United States Supreme Commander of Allied Powers">Theatre
				Headquarters</org> of Tokyo--<del>Gen</del> had on Nov 21st informed Wash DC that my
			request could not be favorably consider. It does not seem fair or Democratic policy to
			allow the <org reg="Tokyo American Catholic Women's Club">American Catholic Womens
				Club</org> of <add>the</add> Tokyo area--a small unimportant foreign group of women
			who had protested against references to BC in a book <title type="book">Japanese Natural
				Resources</title> by Prof <person reg="Ackerman, Edward">Ed Ackerman</person> of the
				<org reg="University of Chicago">Univ of <place reg="Chicago, IL"
				>Chicago</place></org></p>
		<p>Over 2500 copies of this book had been halted in destination of reference to BC
			eliminated according to a <supplied resp="MSPP">statement</supplied> by Col <person
				reg="Schenck, Hubert Gregory">Schenck</person></p>
