				<q who="BDE">Arriving late yesterday on the <org reg="White Star Lines">White
						Star</org> liner <name type="ship">Majestic</name> was Margaret Sanger, who
					said that if her birth control activities in <place>Italy</place> had become
					known recently she believed she would have been deported.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"By traveling under my married name, Mrs. M. S. Slee, I managed to hold many private
				meetings on birth control while in Italy,"<q who="BDE"> she said.</q> "In <place
					reg="Venice, Italy">Venice</place> and <place reg="Milan, Italy">Milan</place> I
				had more demand for secret lectures before women's clubs than I could supply." </p>
			<p>"In spite of <person reg="Mussolini, Benito">Mussolini</person>'s opposition to birth
				control I noticed a great underground movement for it in his country, which has
				undoubtedly been responsible for the astonishing face that the birth rate has fallen
				here this year."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="BDE">Miss Sanger said she would fight for passage of a bill now before the
						<org reg="United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary">Judiciary
						Committee</org> in <org reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> which
					would permit instruction in birth control by physicians.</q>
