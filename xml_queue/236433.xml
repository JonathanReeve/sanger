		<p>We hear a great deal today about preserving institutions of democracy, liberty to future
			generations, but these institutions will take care of themselves if the people have the
			ability to use &amp; appreciate them. It is not the <add>loss of</add> institutions or
			traditions that I fear--but the kind of people we are breeding to form <del>the
				next</del> future generations. This is the real question of today &amp; tomorrow. To
				<del>base</del> infer that the quality of our <del>people</del> population depends
			upon the birth rate of college graduates is tinsel thinking. There are deeper &amp;
			sounder qualities <add>of democracy</add> ingrained in the <place>Arizona</place>
			country than in thousands of college graduates. There is potential qualities of sound
			thinking ingrained &amp; bred in artisans &amp; <unclear resp="MSPP">medians</unclear>
			which is a necessary corner stone of any civilization a selective birth rate will soon
			be in order.</p>
		<p>An exciting controversial experiment for a scientific group to present to the world is to
			draft, a set of qualities necessary for the human vessel to contain--man--during the
			next hundred years--what shall those qualities be? Should each nation pool its desires
			&amp; ideals? We should doubtless find out. </p>
		<p>The <org reg="International Union for the Scientific Investigation of Population Problems">Int
				Pop union</org> might exert its imagination a little &amp; recent statements set up
			an alarm that old men &amp; women are to inherit this earth--well what of it? As we are
			neither old or young we may be allowed to set forth unprejudiced opinions.</p>
		<p>In Oct 1846. <add><org reg="Ireland Relief Commission">Irish Relief Works</org></add>
			114,000 persons employed on Relief Works.</p>
		<p>In Nov. 285,000. In Dec 440,000</p>
		<p>‘’ Jan 1847 it grew to 570,000.</p>
		<p>‘’ Feb ‘’ ‘’ ‘’ 708,000.</p>
		<p>‘’ March ‘’ ‘’ ‘’ 735,000</p>
		<p>heads of families or about four millions of persons living on payment obtained out of the
			taxation of other people, which they got for little more than idling away their time, on
			works that were not absolutely necessary to be done at all”</p>
		<p>At the same time, the essential works of the world could not get done, it was difficult
			to get a coat patched, or a pair of shoes mended &amp; whenever relief works were
			established the necessary agricultural work was being neglected. Farmers could not get
			their fields tilled. Relief works were too “attractive.”</p>
		<p> In <place>France</place> 1886--<person reg="Bernard, M.">M. Bernard</person> deputy
			proposed to the <org reg="France Chamber of Deputies">French Chamber</org> that the
			state should educate the seventh child of all parents--who had seven living
			children--but limited the sum to be spent upon this ridiculous idea to &pound;16.000
			($80,000) annually. It was shown it would take a million sterling or 10 million dollars
			a year to carry out this idea in all cases. After a long debate an act was passed
			limiting assistance to the families of the poor. &pound;40 a year ($200)--Malthusian
			editors commit to the effect that parents with more than three children when they could
			not educate &amp; provide for should have been “deprived of some privilege” since it is
			often these poor large families that the greatest amount of poverty, misery, sickness
			&amp; death is found.</p>
		<p> This act will tend to incite the poorest classes of France to plunge themselves yet
			deeper into poverty, misery &amp; degradation.</p>
		<p> All agree that the set goal for the next three years is to concentrate &amp; direct all
			our efforts &amp; resources toward getting B.C. a fact of county, state, &amp; national
			public health work--</p>
		<p><del>But</del>
			<add>While</add> that is an irrefutable goal--&amp; unflinchingly to <del>be</del> aim
			for. There are millions of mothers &amp; fathers too who will not come under public
			health care &amp; whose sacrifice, independence &amp; cues view responsibly for their
			children entitles them to the same consideration given to private persons who do not
			desire to become a public charge. </p>
		<p>These two groups comprise millions of our population &amp; from their increase or
			controlled birth rates shall emerge the problems or complexities of generations yet to
			come.</p>
		<p>The B.C. movement might decide to tackle both groups--dividing its interests according to
			its support general public health--for millions--</p>
		<p> Private clinics (extramural) for their small pay, self respect independent parents who
			prefer to pay as they go-- </p>
