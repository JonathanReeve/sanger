		<head>MARGARET SANGER'S OWN CORNER</head>
		<p>M. S. L. The best person to advise you in regard to Birth Control is your doctor. As you
			evidently need such advice, go to him and ask him. If he is unable or unwilling to help
			you, write to me again, and send your address.</p>
		<p> G. B. asks if two children are the right number for parents to have. It is impossible to
			give a yes or no answer to this question. The number in a family should be in accordance
			with the health of the mother, with the income and circumstances of the family, and with
			the desires of the parents. Some women ought not to have children at all. Others may
			welcome and care adequately for four or even more.</p>
		<p>Here are two questions about the opposition of the Roman Catholics to Birth Control:</p>
		<p>I. D. N. asks: "<q who="UNK">Have you a pamphlet answering the Catholics?</q>"</p>
		<p>My reply is that I have never been able to find out what there is to answer. If I. D. N.
			will send me their objections, I will be glad to try to meet them.</p>
		<p>F. McM. writes: "<q who="UNK">Why do the Catholics object to Birth Control?</q>"</p>
		<p>All I can say is, I don't know. I would like to find out.</p>
