		<div type="section">
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, this bill, S. 4436,
				directly affects the health, the future development and the happiness of 25,000,000
				married women of child-bearing age in this country. </p>
			<p>It further affects indirectly the health, happiness, and future welfare of 45,000,000
				children in this country, of which 10,000,000 are said to be handicapped, according
				to the reports of 1,400 experts who came to this city at the call of <person
					reg="Hoover, Herbert">President Hoover </person>at the <org
					reg="White House Conference on Child Health and Protection">White House
					conference</org> about a year ago.</p>
			<p> At that conference President Hoover said:</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">We approach all problems of childhood with affection. Theirs is the
					province of joy and good humor. They are the most wholesome part of the race,
					the sweetest, for they are fresher from the hands of <name type="deity"
						>God</name>.</q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">The fundamental purpose of this conference is to set forth an
					understanding of those safeguards which will assure to them health in mind and
					body. There are safeguards and services to be childhood which can be provided by
					the community, the State, or the Nation--all of which are beyond the reach of
					the individual present</q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">Let no one believe that these are questions which should not stir a
					nation; that they are below the dignity of statesmen or governments. If we could
					have but one generation of properly born, trained, educated, and healthy
					children, a thousand other problems of government would vanish. We would assure
					ourselves of healthier minds in more vigorous bodies to direct the energies of
					our Nation to yet greater heights of achievement. Moreover, one good community
					nurse will save a dozen future policemen.</q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">Our problem falls into three groups: First, the protection and
					stimulation of the normal child; second, aid to the physically defective and
					handicappled child; third, the problems of the delinquent child.</q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">Findings: Of 45,000,000 children in the United States more than
					10,000,000 are handicapped thus:<list>
						<item>Improperly nourished: 6,000,000</item>
						<item>Defective speech: 1,000,000</item>
						<item>Weak or damanged hearts: 1,000,000</item>
						<item>Behavior problems: 675,000</item>
						<item>Mentally retarded: 450,000</item>
						<item>Tubercular: 382,000</item>
						<item>Impaired hearing: 342,000</item>
						<item>Totally deaf: 18,000</item>
						<item>Crippled: 300,000</item>
						<item>Partially blind: 50,000</item>
						<item>Wholly blind: 14,000</item>
						<item>Delinquent: 200,000</item>
						<item>Dependent: 500,000</item>
					</list></q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">And so on, to a total of at least 10,000,000 of deficients, more than
					80 per cent of whom are not receiving necessary attention, though our knowledge
					and experience show that these deficiencies can be prevented and remedied to a
					high degree.</q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">But that we be not discouraged, let us bear in mind that there are
					35,000,000 reasonably normal, cheerful human electrons radiating joy and
					mischief and hope and faith.</q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">And also, on the bright side, your reports show that we have 1,500,000
					specially gifted children. There lies the future leadership of the Nation if we
					devote ourselves to their guidance.</q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">It is not the delinquent child that is at the bar of judgement, but
					society itself. Industry must not rob children of their rightful heritage. Any
					labor which stunts growth, either physical or mental, that limits education,
					that deprives children of the right of comradeship, of joy and play, is sapping
					the next generation.</q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="WHC">Human progress marches only when children excel their parents.</q>
			</p>
			<p> Now, Mr. Chairman, you might say how does this bill affect handicapped children. It
				directly affects the handicapped children because as some of our experts here today
				will show the mothers of these handicapped children are needed for the care of these
				children.</p>
			<p> Furthermore, according to these reports, it is stated that a large percentage of
				these children were handicapped from causes due to ignorance, poverty, and
				neglect.</p>
			<p> Even the most optimistic of us will not claim that we are going to do away with
				poverty, ignorance, and neglect in the next few years, and yet these 1,400 experts
				did not emphasize that the parents of these 10,000,000 children should have the
				knowledge and means and instruction to prevent the coming of 10,000,000 more
				children, who may be handicapped from the same causes of poverty, ignorance, and
				neglect.</p>
			<p> To me it is just a simple piece of common sense that people who can not take care of
				children to-day, because they are ignorant, or because they are too poor, or because
				they neglect them, certainly should not be encouraged to have more children.</p>
			<p> In my own experience, both as the mother of three children, and as a trained nurse
				for many years in <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>, I came in contact
				with all kinds of people, representing the poor of all races, all creeds, and all
				religions.</p>
			<p> I found that there are a certain number of people, perhaps we can say 20 per cent of
				our population today, who in spite of these laws have availed themselves of some
				kind of knowledge by which they have controlled the size of their families. Of the
				other 80 per cent, I found that about half are struggling to find something to
				control the size of their families, while the other half are those generally classed
				as unfit, mentally and physically, and include morons and mental defectives who
				usually come upon our social vista as permanent unemployable and dependants. It is
				for this other 40 per cent, you might say, or half of the 80 per cent, that we are
				talking to-day. It is these people that this bill will directly affect.</p>
			<p> Mr. Chairman, you asked <person reg="Hatfield, Henry">Senator Hatfield </person>a
				few questions that I wonder if I may cover. These parents, if they can afford to go
				to a private physician, if they have a family doctor, may get some kind of
				information as to the means of controlling the size of their families. It may not be
				the best advice, but nevertheless it is something, and it has enabled a certain
				percentage of our population to control the size of their families. Is it better
				than nothing, but the majority of women, those who are too poor to have a family
				physician, have to go to the hospitals and public institutions. They have to go to
				the dispensaries and to public wards to get their medical care and it is right here
				that this law operates. While a physician may in his private office do and say as he
				wishes; he may give some device and no one can ask him where he gets it; as soon as
				he is connected with an institution the situation is entirely changed. In the first
				place the hospital would have to order and pay for contraceptive supplies which he
				might prescribe. In the second place he would be accountable to the laws of the
				country for his action that institution, and he can not thus jeopardize his own
				license nor the charter of the institution which operate legally under the State
				laws.</p>
			<p> There is where this law operates, because the law, section 211, definitely forbids
				the transportation of articles or of information through the United States mails or
				common carriers. Unless every hospital has a manufacturing plant associated with it,
				or in the city where it is located, you will see that they must get their articles
				either from New York or <place reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</place> or some large city
				where the articles are manufactured.</p>
			<p> The <name type="law" reg="United States Tariff Act, Section 305">tariff act, section
					305</name>, affects such articles coming in from other countries.</p>
			<p> Many physicians do not know that there is a great deal of research going on in this
				particular field in <place>England</place>, in <place reg="Oxford, England"
					>Oxford</place>, and <place reg="Cambridge, England">Cambridge</place>, also the
					<org>University of Edinburgh</org>, <place>Scotland</place>. A great deal is
				being accomplished there because they are unhampered by restrictive laws and are
				free to do research, while we in this country are years behind in medical research
				in this particular field.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: You do not happen to have a copy of that section
					211?</q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: I have, Mr. Chairman.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: Were you going to put any part of that in the
					record?</q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: I would like all of it to go in the record, with your permission, Mr.
				Chairman. I have not only the statutes in question, but I have some of the legal
				opinions that have recently been given by the courts, both on the tariff act and
				also on <name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">section
					211</name> as it affects the transportation of the articles in the mails, if you
				will permit these to go in.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: As a matter of fact I was in error when I suggested
					to Senator Hatfield that this affected only the importation of articles. The
					most important thing is the at the end of your remarks. </q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: All right. May I say again that the Federal law, section 211, makes no
				exception for physicians. It makes no exception for hospitals to get such supplies.
				It makes no exception for anyone. Any one convicted under this law is subjected to
				give years in prison and $5,000 fine. In this country the laws of 47 States allow a
				physician to give contraceptive information in his practice. Some of them are
				limited. In <place>New York</place> State he can only give information “for the cure
				and prevention of disease.” In <place>New Jersey </place>he can give it “for a just
				cause.” In 24 States the subject of contraception is not mentioned in their laws at
				all.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: This law does not help there, does it? </q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: It does by allowing them to transport the articles through the mails,
				also common carriers.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: Yes; but of course these State laws remain in
					effect.</q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: Absolutely; but there is only one State in the Union where giving of
				advice would be doubtful, and that is <place>Mississippi</place>. All the other
				States give a physician the right to give such information in his private practice
				provided he can get the things from the manufacturer. That is what our amendment
				provides for.</p>
			<p> When this law was passed in 1873 there was very little known concerning the whole
				subject; certainly there was no real information concerning the medical and
				sociological importance of the practice of contraception. The subject of birth
				control or contraception was wrongly classed with indecency, obscenity, and
				abortion. The passage of this law in 1873 really closed the avenues of proper
				scientific information and research by the medical profession, medical schools, and
				medical universities in this country.</p>
			<p> It has done untold harm to classify contraception in that category. It Is an insult
				to every decent married woman in the country who wants to bring up her family
				intelligently; it prevents her from applying the benefits of science to the
				cultivation of her children and the bringing up of her family; and, furthermore, to
				all intents and purposes it classifies every married woman in this country as a
				“child bearing conscript.” Unless a woman has some means of preventing conception
				and spacing her children, she is forced to bear children like an animal, and in fact
				animals are not allowed to breed in sickness and with diseased bodies as the women
				of this country are made to do to-day, as I will show you a little later on.</p>
			<p> This bill is simple; it is conservative; it is constructive, because it simply
				allows the physician at a hospital, or licensed clinic, to receive such supplies and
				to give such information.</p>
			<p> The passage of this bill would be the first attempt on the part of the Congress to
				place the responsibility of giving contraceptive instruction in the hands of the
				medical profession, where it rightly belongs.</p>
			<p> It would be the first attempt on the part of Congress to give the medical profession
				the control of such knowledge; which we know is very promiscuously scattered about
				to-day. It would let physicians regulate the kind of devices used, and thus wipe out
				the present traffic in wrong and harmful devices. The poor mothers, the people who
				should have the information, are uninformed and are denied the proper kind of
				devices suitable to their own individual requirements.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: If you do not mind me interrupting you-- </q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: No.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: It occurs to me paragraph numbered 3 might be a
					little uncertain “by any druggist in his legitimate prescription business.” What
					is intended by that? </q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: That the physician would prescribe certain devices, tested by research
				and experience in our clinics. The druggist should be able to supply these devices.
				We have found that contraceptives, to be properly safe and harmless, should be
				prescribed according to the individual requirements. just as eyeglasses must be
				individually fitted by oculists.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: What I was interested in was whether it was
					intended that a person might apply to the druggist without going to the
					physician at all. </q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: No. According to that I would understand that a person must have a
				physician’s prescription.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: I am anxious to find out what is your intent.</q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: That is our intent, that it should be by prescription. </p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: By prescription only? </q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: Yes. I do not wish to go into great detail concerning different methods
				and devices for contraception. However, there are certain articles, which are
				commonly used as contraceptives, but which may also be used for the cure and
				prevention of disease. These articles, according to a recent court decision may be
				legally transmitted through the <place>United States</place> mails. However, there
				are certain other articles which are used only for the prevention of conception,
				which are now excluded from the mails. These articles must be prescribed by a
				physician, and only after a thorough physical examination, so that the prescription
				varies with the individual. It is like any other medical advice, highly individual
				and adapted to the particular requirements of the patient. It is to such articles
				that we refer, and it is for these that the law must be changed. </p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: There would be no objection to changing that to
					read “by any druggist upon a written prescription of a licensed physician”?</q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: There would be no objection whatever.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: I wanted to get your thought, so that after all
					what you are seeking here is all limited to physicians or medical colleges,
					which are really controlled by physicians. </q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: Yes; they are already controlled by physicians. In many States the
				medical colleges are free to instruct their young graduates and physicians in this
				particular art, as hey are instructed in other departments, but this has not
				generally been done up to the present time. There are comparatively few medical
				colleges that include a course in contraception in their regular curriculum.</p>
			<p> I want to say in passing that where the laws allow a physician within the State to
				give information, some clinics have been established. Some of the social agencies
				and some of the forward-looking physicians are to-day struggling to solve their
				immediate problems, not only health problems, but social problems as well. The
				problem of unemployment, the whole question of congestion, is coming before them as
				never before. Birth control helps to solve some of these problems, but even where
				clinics are already in operation, it is difficult to obtain ether the best
				information or supplies, under the present law. The proposed amendment would release
				the physician and make this information available, also, in public institutions such
				as clinics and hospitals.</p>
			<p> Mr. Chairman, if I may digress for a moment, I want to go into an even broader
				aspect of the question. </p>
			<p>Birth control is not a new idea. It is as old as nature itself. In fact, even in the
				period of savagery there was some means, some knowledge of controlling the numbrs in
				the tribes. It is only the methods that have changed. </p>
			<p>Instead of infanticide and killing off the old and sick as has been done at various
				stages in the development of civilization, the only means of controlling the size of
				her family which is left to woman is abortion.</p>
			<p>The number of abortion in this country is colossal, and we are convinced that only
				through a proper knowledge of contraception shall we do away with this abortion
				practice, one which is extremely detrimental to the health and happiness of women. </p>
			<p>Let us now consider the two groups of people, those who practice birth control and
				those who do not. If you will look into every community, and every city and every
				town, you will see on the one hand small groups who have controlled the size of
				their families and on the other hand you will see a larger group who have not even
				been able to avail themselves of any information whatever. In the first group, we
				have the educated, cultured, well-to-do citizens, professors, doctors, lawyers,
				ministers, scientists, artisans, and skilled laborers. Here we find the spacing of
				children an adopted rule, the mother’s health being the first consideration and the
				earning power of the father a close second. From this group come almost all of our
				social movements. Civilization is directly benefited and advanced through this low
				birth rate group. In the other large family group we have overcrowding, illiteracy,
				ignorance, slums, infant and maternal mortality, and child labor. Almost all our
				social problems are entrenched in this group and these conditions and their problems
				are perpetuated from generation to generation. </p>
			<p>I, myself, have found that the mothers in both groups are equally desirous of
				bringing into the world only the number of children they can properly care for. I
				find that even women of the very lowest grade of intelligence are willing to avail
				themselves of information to prevent conception at any cost and at any trouble to
				themselves. I have, during the past several years, receive over a million letters,
				the great majority of these letters coming from mothers and from women, especially
				in this second group. I should like to read a few of these letters which are rather
				typical of the conditions that prevail throughout the country--conditions that the
				passage of this bill would help:</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">Twenty nine years old, mother of nine children: "<q who="UNK">I am
					a Catholic 29 years old. I was married at 17 years of age and the first baby was
					born after 9 months 1 day. I have now been married 12 years have had 9 children.
					6 are living and 3 are dead. I have had children every year since 1925. My
					husband is out of work now, so you see how hard it is to keep going and to pay
					one's debts and expenses for hospitals and doctors."</q></p>
			<p rend="blockquote">Seventeen children at 35:"<q who="UNK">I am 35 and the mother of 17
					children, the last one not yet 2 months old, and I am in great hopes you can
					help me some way. Our net income during the winter has been $28 a month and out
					of that we have had to pay all our groceries, fuel, and clothes.</q></p>
			<p rend="blockquote">"<q who="UNK">I had the fond hope of becoming a teacher, but all I
					could do was six grades in public school, then out to work, fitted for nothing,
					so all I could do was housework at $1 a week. So I married, hoping to resume my
					studies at night school, but almost at once there was a pregnancy. Is it
					necessary to have my children grow up with no more hope or vision for their
					future than I've had? So many babies, never a time between them; why, one year I
					had one baby in January and twins the next December.</q></p>
			<p rend="blockquote">"<q who="UNK">I am pleading with you to help me some way.</q>"</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">Seven children at 30: "<q who="UNK">Will you please tell me about
					birth control? Our doctor refuses to tell us. I am 30 years old and have been
					married 11 years. My oldest child is 10 years old and I have 7 children and
					expect another baby next month. I had my last baby born dead last October. She
					was crippled and deformed. We are poor people trying to get along at $90 a
					month. Please help me.</q>"</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">Thirty-four years old; 12 pregnancies: :<q who="UNK">I am only 34

					so quickly after they are born, it seems they don't have strength to live long.

					never for long. We're poor people, Mrs. Sanger, and the coffins of the last two
					are not paid for yet. It's hard on a woman to see them go like that and I think
					if I did not have any for a while I could keep the three I've got and give them
					better than we ever had. Please help me. I'll be watching the postman waiting
					for your answer. Please don't fail me.</q>"</p>
			<p> Eight years in pregnancy for three children. Cruelty beyond belief! Nine little
				coffins. The <org>United States Government</org> would help her rear and breed pigs,
				cows, chickens, but makes laws to deprive mothers of knowledge to perfect and
				develop the human race.</p>
			<p>A 75 per cent loss; sordid; a business man would shut up his shop. We are paying
				to-day for these laws of nearly 60 years ago. We are paying for them by the
				multiplication of the unfit, the diseased, the feeble-minded. We are paying for them
				in our high maternal mortality, in the hordes of death-doomed infants who never see
				their first birthday, in the widespread practice of abortions, in child labor, in
				the waste of mother power and creative energy. We are paying the cost in increasing
				billions and piling up huge debts for unborn generations to pay.</p>

			<head>STATEMENT OF MRS. MARGARET SANGER--Continued</head>
			<dateline><date value="1932-05-20">FRIDAY, MAY 20, 1932</date>, Washington,
				D.C.</dateline>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: Mr Chairman, and gentlemen of the committee, in consideration of the
				time of the committee and their generosity in allowing us so much time to bring this
				discussion and subject before you, I will forego the impulse to answer and refute
				many of the personal accusations and charges that were made by the opposition in
				their testimony yesterday.</p>
			<p> I just want to make this remark, that this committee, the persons in this work, and
				their character, their integrity, and their standing in the communities throughout
				the city, need no defense; and so I am going to continue this morning just on the
				merits and on the facts of the subject, as we have found them.</p>
			<p> You will notice, Mr. Chairman, that while those who appeared against this bill gave
				some very representative opinions, they were mostly personal. They were not backed
				up by facts, and they were theories rather than practice.</p>
			<p> For instance, <person reg="Kelly, Howard Atwood">Doctor Kelly</person>, a noted
				physician, who has won a world-wide reputation in the field of medicine, appeared
				before you, not to talk about the merits of the bill, nor to give any evidence from
				a medical point of view at all, but to defend public morals; while <person
					reg="Ryan, John Augustine">Dr. John Ryan,</person> a member of the <org>Roman
					Catholic Church</org>, came to theorize on economics and the population aspect
				of the whole question.</p>
			<p> All of these opinions are interesting, and the discussions of the wider aspects of
				this bill are all right and good, but you will note there was no constructive policy
				offered in substitution for this bill. There was nothing constructive suggested as a
				means to do away with the various conditions to which they object that they claim
				are so prevalent in this country. As a matter of fact, the facts that were presented
				by the proponents of this bill were not refuted in any of the arguments or
				testimony, and when you sum it all up and weed out the personal opinions, you will
				find there was really no objection whatsoever made on the actual merits of this
				bill.</p>
			<p> Not one person, in opposing the bill, claimed that a physician should not have the
				right to instruct patients as he saw fit; in fact, <person
					reg="Chase, William Sheafe">Canon Chase</person> stated that no sensible person
				could oppose giving to trustworthy physicians freedom to do what is necessary to
				protect the life of a woman which would be endangered by another pregnancy, if her
				husband can not control himself.</p>
			<p> I will take up some of the objections and try to answer them briefly. In the first
				place, our opponents claim that this bill will throw the mails wide open to the free
				and illicit distribution of contraceptive information. Their claim is ridiculous.
				The bill simply asks that a physician shall have the right to send and receive
				contraceptive information and supplies by the United States mails and common
				carriers, and also that such supplies and information may be sent to hospitals and
				licensed clinics.</p>
			<p> We know that physicians do not prescribe by mail. Any physician that knows his
				business at all must have the patient before him, and I must examine the patient to
				give her the best and most suitable contraceptive instruction and means for her
				individual case.</p>
			<p> However, to do that he must first have up-to-date information himself, which we know
				in many cases is sadly lacking, because there has been no instruction in medical
				schools on the technique of contraception. Furthermore, information and advice alone
				are not sufficient. The physician must give some chemical or mechanical means to
				prevent conception, in order to protect the woman properly.</p>
			<p> We know that physicians differ in their opinions regarding the subject. They differ
				because to a great extent they have not been taught in their medical schools. This
				is especially true of the older physicians, many of whom in the past have been
				taught much more on the technique of therapeutic abortions; they were not taught
				contraception at all, and you will find that it is these men who oppose our bill,
				because they simply are ignorant of the whole technique of contraception.</p>
			<p> It was brought out that the <org>American Medical Association</org> had repudiated
				this bill. That is untrue. The American Medical Association at its annual convention
				in <place reg="New Orleans, LA">New Orleans</place> last week, took no action on any
				bill. One must remember that the American Medical Association is composed of about
				150,000 doctors, of which only about 9,000 would be really directly concerned with
				this question. These are the gynecologists and obstetricians, and that very group of
				gynecologists and obstetricians went on record a few years ago and gave the opinion
				that there should be no legislation curtailing the freedom of the physician in his
				lawful practice. Their resolution was offered as testimony in the early part of our
				proceedings.</p>
			<p>I have here just an indication of what the medical profession feels. Here is a
				symposium, printed in the <title type="journal">Medical Journal and Record</title>
				in 1927. Two hundred and seventy-three doctors replied to the symposium, and of this
				number 248 were in favor of birth control, and proper legislation. Nineteen were
				against it. Two of them were unable to express an opinion. One thought contraceptive
				methods would bring abuses. One said that methods should be advised only after
				consultation with physicians and with the sanction of the United States Government
				and the <title type="book">Bible</title>. One thought that this generation knows too
				much about such things, and the poor would not avail themselves of this
				information.</p>
			<p> Another symposium appeared lated [later] in 1929, in the same <title type="journal"
					>Journal and Record</title>. One hundred and eighteen doctors replied to the
				questionnaire. Of this number 99 said they were in favor of contraception. Four said
				they were not informed sufficiently to express an opinion. Fifteen were opposed.</p>
			<p> I think that to a certain degree gives a brief indication, not a summary, but a
				cross section, of the general opinion of the medical profession.</p>
			<p> I have also included in the record a list of medical societies and medical groups, a
				large number of which have indorsed this particular bill, the rest having indorsed
				the principles of contraception.</p>
			<p>Dr. <person reg="Morgan, Gerry">Gerry Morgan</person>, as past president of the
				American Medical Association did not testify before you as a physician to discuss
				the merits of the bill but stated that he was here to speak on the “natural” laws of
				the universe.</p>
			<p>One ex-president of the American Medical Association opposes this legislation while
				two others have fully supported it. The late Dr. <person reg="Jacobi, Abraham"
					>Abraham Jacobi</person>, former president of the American Medical Association,
				made a very excellent pronouncement on the whole subject some years ago, and was
				really the first one to bring this subject to the attention of the medical
				profession. A few years ago, Dr. <person reg="Pusey, William Allen">William Allen
					Pusey</person> in his statement accepting the presidency of the American Medical
				Association also held out squarely on the proper dissemination and regulation of
				contraceptive information by the medical profession.</p>
			<p> Our opponents made the statement that the use of any contraceptive invariably had
				effect upon the pelvic organs and nervous system. That statement is an indication of
				the ignorance of some of the members of the medical profession.</p>
			<p> We have in one <org reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">clinic</org> in New
				York City cared for and instructed over 28,000 women, whose records we have. A
				follow-up is made of these women. Social workers go into the homes. We have these
				actual facts, and within a very short period– we could present the data now,
				although it would be voluminous– a detailed report covering the first 10,000 of
				these cases is to be published.</p>
			<p> We know it to be true that the great majority of these women have greatly benefited
				by this information, or rather by the rest they have had from pregnancy. Their
				health has improved. Their family conditions have improved. The whole happiness of
				the family has been increased. The children have been better cared for. In a very
				few cases, of course, there have been failures. These constitute, however, a very
				small percentage of the total, and in a very few instances women have resorted to
				abortions.</p>
			<p> I would like, if I may, to offer for the record brief summaries of some of these
				cases to show you what their conditions are, the number of living children, and the
				number of dead children. Let me just read one.</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">An Italian woman, 29 years old on first visit (married at 15
				years). She was diagnosed as a high-grade moron, with husband classified as mental
				case. Three children, youngest--an infant, two miscarriages, both due to
				overwork--five pregnancies in all. Clinical contraceptive advice has now been
				successful for four years. This family is able to carry on without help from social
				agencies because of the limitation of offspring.</p>
			<p> We have a number of cases like this, Mr. Chairman, but I only read one for your
				information.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: Do you want it put in the record?</q>
			</p>
			<p> Mrs. Sanger: I would like to if I may.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: The committee will look at it to determine whether
					or not it should go in the record.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="AUSWA">Senator Austin: I think those papers may go in the record.</q>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<supplied resp="MSPP">A listing of 23 similar short descriptions of cases from the
						<org>Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</org>, a summary of a "Study of
					Geniuses" and their birth order, which included a short statement by Dean
						<person reg="Inge, William Ralph">William Inge</person> of the <org>Church
						of England</org> were omitted by the MSPP editors. </supplied>
			</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">The inference is often made by our opponents that the genius is
				born at the end of a large family, usually the eleventh or twelfth, or perhaps the
				fifteenth child. The Bible tells us that some of the most remarkable characters were
				the first children, and often the only child as well. </p>
			<p rend="blockquote">For instance:</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">"<q who="UNK"><person reg="Isaac (Biblical)">Issac</person>, in
					whose seed all the nations were to be blessed, was an only child, born after
					long years of preparation. <person reg="Sarah (Biblical)">Sarah</person>, his
					mother, was a beautiful, talented woman, whose counsel was highly valued.
					Isaac's only children were twins--<person reg="Jacob (Biblical)">Jacob</person>,
					the father of all <place>Israel</place>, and <person reg="Esau (Biblical)"
						>Esau</person>. Isaac's wife, <person reg="Rebekeh (Biblical)"
						>Rebecca</person>, was also a lovely woman of fine character, whose opinion
					was sought and valued. <person reg="Joseph (patriarch) (Biblical)"
						>Joseph</person>, the son of <person reg="Rachel (Biblical)"
					>Rachel</person>, was born late in her life, and she had but one other child.
						<person reg="Samuel (Biblical)">Samuel</person>, who judged Israel for 40
					years, was an only child, born after years and prayer and supplication on the
					part of <person reg="Hannah (Biblical)">Hannah</person>. <person
						reg="John the Baptist (Biblical)">John the Baptist</person> was an only
					child, and his parents were well along in years when he was born.</q>"</p>
			<p>"<q who="UNK"><person reg="Jesus Christ">Jesus</person> was the first born of <person
						reg="Joseph (Biblical)">Joseph</person> and <person reg="Virgin Mary (Biblical)"
						>Mary</person> and had no children.</q>"</p>

			<p>Mrs. Sanger: As for the other statement along the same line, that there is harm to
				women, there is a report here by Dr. <person reg="Butler, Lily C.">Lily
					Butler</person>, medical officer of the <org>Walworth Women’s Welfare
					Center</org>, an English group, which has made a careful follow up for this
				particular reason, to see what effect the use of contraceptives have upon the health
				of women and to see if it caused sterility:</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">
				<q who="BUTLI">We note that 101 patients have wanted another child after periods
					varying from one to five years, and in 98 of those cases they have become
					pregnant on discontinuing the use of the contraceptives.</q>
			</p>
			<p> This is a simple statement of one of the clinics where they have followed this up. I
				mention this to show that we are after facts. We are trying to study this question,
				and we have had a long enough period now, nearly 10 years, on which to base our
				judgement of what this is going to do, what it is doing, and what it has done. </p>
			<p>One statement has been made many times by our opponents, and although it is beside
				the question, I would like to cover it. I think it was one of the doctors who stated
				that leaders of the world would have come from large families and that not
				infrequently the last child born had been "the flower of the flock.”</p>
			<p> I have already put into the record some data relative to that, which I would ask the
				committee to read. <supplied resp="MSPP">Reference made to the page number for the
					genius study</supplied></p>
			<p>The opponents to this bill offer continence as a means for limiting the family, and
				for doing what we claim birth control will do. We know the population of countries
				where this is advocated, and we also know that this population does not practice
				continence. When they say self-control, I would like to ask what they mean by
				self-control.</p>
			<p> As I stated before to the committee, there are three methods of birth-control; one
				is continence, one is sterilization, and the other is chemical or mechanical means
				of contraception. We refuse to say– in fact, we can not say– that any one method is
				suitable for all the population. There may be many people for whom continence may be
				the very best method to be prescribed.</p>
			<p> We have with us today a specialist who will dwell more upon this phase of the
				subject, but I would like to say this: It is intimated that self-control refers to a
				safe period, or a period in a woman’s life where she is immune to pregnancy. I think
				the gynecologists and most of the experts in this field of medicine will say that
				there is only a very small percentage of women– I have heard it stated that it is
				not even 1 per cent– who could be said to have a safe period, when they are safe
				from pregnancy.</p>
			<p> Moreover, if they mean abstinence, that is entirely out of order, for then they are
				claiming that there should be no relations whatsoever except when children are
				desired.</p>
			<p> We know that sexual desire is very seldom accompanied by a desire for children. Very
				seldom. It precedes the desire for children, and I am not going to take this up,
				because <person reg="Meyer, Adolf">Dr. Adolf Meyer,</person> professor at <org>Johns
					Hopkins University</org>, will discuss this subject and will explain it more
				clearly than I can.</p>
			<p> Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that there can be no objection to this bill as it has
				been drawn, and I want to say further that the original bill presented before the
				subcommittee of the judiciary last year was drafted by two distinguished lawyers,
				Mr. <person reg="Fosdick, Raymond">Raymond Fosdick</person> and Mr. <person
					reg="Tweed, Harrison">Harrison Tweed</person>, of New York, men who have given a
				great deal of study to social legislation.</p>
			<p> In order to conform with some of those who disagreed with that bill, we tried to get
				together and see if we could not agree upon one bill, in order to save the lives of
				thousands of women, and to settle this question.</p>
			<p> Mr. Chairman, I want to say that we cut out from our original bill many points so as
				to agree with the very people who appeared here yesterday against us, and as I say,
				they have not objected to the merits of this bill.</p>
			<p> This bill is conservative; it is constructive; it is going to do something more
				definitely constructive than anything that has yet been offered.</p>
			<p> Our opponents claim there is promiscuous distribution of supplies, articles, and
				information in the country. Of course there is; not because there are no laws, but
				because there are laws. As soon as this responsibility is given to the proper
				people– I believe there will be a gradual elimination of this promiscuous scattering
				of devices, and of information, which is mostly misinformation.</p>
			<p> That, Mr. Chairman, is my contention.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: Mrs. Sanger, I do not think the opponents of this
					bill make any claim that they have offered any solution. I do not remember that
					they did, certainly no legislative solution.</q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: No.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: Did you read that report of some conference, I
					think, held in England, by the <org>Episcopal Church</org>?</q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: Yes.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: What have you to say with respect to that
					opposition?</q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: It was not opposition, Mr. Chairman. That was the <org>Lambeth
					Conference of Anglican Bishops</org>. I think we offered that in evidence the
				other day; resolution 15, carried by 193 votes to 67. Some of the resolutions stated
				that continence would be the advisable thing, and an ideal solution to birth
				control. There was a further discussion of birth control, however, and the
				conference agreed that where there is a morally sound reason for avoiding complete
				continence, other methods may be used, provided this is done in the light of the
				same Christian principles. That was the statement. </p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: I got the impression from the extract read, they
					condemned the whole idea of contraception. </q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: No; they did not, Mr. Chairman. If you will read it again– I read it
				this morning– they preferred continuance and moral suasion, but in resolution 15,
				they bring out very clearly that, under certain conditions, other methods may be
				sanctioned.</p>
			<p>
				<q who="HASDA">Senator Hastings: Have you somebody else? </q>
			</p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger: Yes. I would like this short paper to go in the record, which reads:</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">It is important to recognize that a knowledge of contraceptive
				methods is used by American families chiefly to control the size of the family,
				rather than to avoid childbearing altogether.</p>
			<p rend="blockquote">The data collected from a representative group of American women,
				over two-thirds of whom were college graduates, by the <org>Bureau of Social
					Hygiene</org> have recently been analyzed with special reference to factors
				affecting size of family by Dr. <person reg="Latimer, Frank">Frank Latimer</person>
				of the <org>Eugenic Research Association</org>. The results of this analysis have
				not yet been published. Seventy per cent of the women over 40 years of age reported
				the use of some means of controlling childbearing. In the case of women reporting
				four children or more over 90 per cent reported the use of some sort of
				contraceptive method. But in the case of childless women, less than 40 per cent had
				ever used contraceptive measures at all and if cases in which contraception was
				practiced temporarily because of ill health or special circumstances it is found
				that only 25 per cent of all childless couples in this sample are voluntarily
				without children, or only 5 per cent of the whole group. </p>
			<p rend="blockquote">This result is in line with the extensive study of fertility in
					<place>England</place> and <place>Wales</place> published by the
				registrar-general's office, in which it was found that during the 50-year period in
				which birth-control measures were being introduced extensively in England although
				large families gradually disappeared there was practically no increase in the
				proportion of childless couples--except in the case of women marrying at an advanced
				age when health considerations become a serious item.</p>
			<p>I would like to introduce Dr. <person reg="Meyer, Adolf">Adolf Meyer</person>, of
					<org>Johns Hopkins University</org>.</p>
