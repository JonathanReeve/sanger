		<head>Good Future Seen for Babies Born During War</head>

		<p>
			<q who="EPHP">The war has helped the planned parenthood movement, Mrs. Margaret Sanger
				of <place reg="Tucson, AZ">Tucson</place>, president of the <org>Birth Control
					Federation of America</org>, said in <place reg="El Paso, TX">El Paso</place>
				today.</q>
		</p>

		<p><q who="EPHP"> While the war has increased the number of small families with the result
				that the <place>United States</place> had one million more babies last year than in
				pre-war times, it has cut down on the number of children per family, Mrs. Sanger
				said.</q></p>

		<p> “War babies” <q who="EPHP">have a good future, because their parents are younger and
				have better health and stamina to give them and because in most instances the babies
				are</q> “wanted” <q who="EPHP">children, Mrs. Sanger said:</q></p>

		<p> “However, we must not overlook the fact that the number of illegitimate children, as
			well as the number of children in orphanages, has increased. That is a bad result, along
			with the good, of the war.”</p>

		<p><q who="EPHP"> Mrs. Sanger believes world-wide control of population growth, as well as
				natural resources, must be considered at the peace table conference.</q>
		</p>

		<p> “Scientists of the world recognize that peace will depend upon population growth.” <q
				who="EPHP">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “If the peace makers do not recognize this factor,
			which caused our enemies today to seek more space for themselves, the world will
			continue in chaos and wars.”</p>
