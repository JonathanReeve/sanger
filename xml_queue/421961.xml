		<q who="TDC">
			<p>Interesting people just naturally have interesting houses.</p>
			<p>And Margaret Sanger Slee is no exception.</p>
			<p>She lives in a delightfully unusual house in <place reg="Tucson, Arizona">Catalina
					Vista,</place> surrounded by treasures she and her late husband collected from
				all over the world.</p>
		</q>
		<p>"In 1952, I asked <person reg="Wright, Frank Lloyd">Frank Lloyd Wright</person> to design
			a house for me. He asked <q who="FLW">'on how many acres?,'</q> and when I said a 150 by
			135 foot lot, he gasped with horror and declined," laughed Mrs. Slee.</p>
		<p>"So then I asked <person reg="Brown, Arthur">Arthur Brown</person> to be my architect.
			Now, of course, I'm delighted that Mr. Wright declined, because Mr. Brown did a perfect
			house for me-exactly what I wanted!"</p>
		<q who="TDC">
			<p>Mrs. Slee explained that she does not care for boxes or square, regular rooms.</p>
		</q>
		<p>"And I didn't want to look out and see the ground. I wanted to see sky, flowers and
			trees."</p>
		<q who="TDC">
			<p><person reg="Caffrey, H.E.">H.E. Caffrey</person> was the contractor and Mrs. Slee
				did the interior decor.</p>
		</q>
		<p>"I just put in the house the things I owned," <q who="TDC">she said.</q></p>
		<q who="TDC">
			<p>And what fabulous things they are! She collected them throughout a lifetime spent
				traveling throughout the world, as the founder of and crusader for <org
					reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">planned parenthood</org> and also
				as the wife of an oil executive who had lived in the <place>Orient</place> since
				1910.</p>
			<p>Mrs. Slee's home is of contemporary design, and makes use of such 20th century
				techniques as curved fiberglass walls and stainless steel mantles. Yet its
				contemporary simplicity makes it a perfect background for exquisite furnishings and
				art objects of all ages and cultures.</p>
