		<p>FRIENDS:</p>
		<p>Standing here before you tonight, my mind is filled with the differences between
			YESTERDAY, TODAY–-and TOMORROW!</p>
		<p> YESTERDAY, TODAY, TOMORROW! These three words stand as symbols for all the changes and
			all the progress we have made.</p>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"> Y E S T E R D A Y</head>
			<p>YESTERDAY:</p>
			<p>To me YESTERDAY stands for the reign of SPOOKS–the rule of FEAR, SUPERSTITIONS and
				the POWERS of DARKNESS.</p>
			<p> Just twenty years ago, our great OFFENSIVE for BIRTH CONTROL BEGAN. It was OFFENSIVE
					<add>, indeed it was!</add>–Offensive to the Conspiracy of Silence concerning
				the most important of all human functions. For me YESTERDAY stands for the great
					<add>smoky</add> battle against those SPOOKS. YESTERDAY every one said to
				me:</p>
			<p> “You <emph rend="underline">can't</emph> say that... You <emph rend="underline"
					>can't</emph> print that. . . You <emph rend="underline">can't</emph> tell them
				that. . . you <emph rend="underline">can't</emph> teach them that! You’ll be
				arrested. . . you’ll be indicted... You’ll be thrown into prison!”</p>
			<p> YESTERDAY meant patrol wagons, indictments, police courts, prison bars. But that was
				the only way to fight the SPOOKS–to drag them out into the <add>pitiless</add> glare
				of publicity and discussion and to <del>examine</del>
				<add>analyze</add> them <del>with</del>
				<add>under</add> the <emph rend="underline">penetrating</emph> light of
				intelligence.</p>
			<p> YESTERDAY we were <emph rend="underline">denounced</emph> from the pulpit, <emph
					rend="underline">jeered</emph> at in the press, <emph rend="underline"
					>hustled</emph> to jail by the police. Our press was suppressed, our meetings
					<emph rend="underline">broken</emph> up, our clinics <emph rend="underline"
					>raided</emph>. BIRTH CONTROL, they said, meant Race Suicide. Birth Control was
				the instrument of the devil, destroyer of the home, the morals of youth, and the
				future of the Nation. BIRTH CONTROL would produce Sterility, Physical Degeneration,
				and the Morals of the YOUNG!</p>
			<p> YESTER DAY <add><emph rend="underline">UNDAUNTED</emph></add> we ploughed the field;
				we sowed the seeds of a new intelligence. <add>TO DAY we are gathering the
					harvest!</add></p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub"><del>TO-DAY</del></head>
			<p>TO-DAY this Conference convinces me that those YESTERDAYS <del>can never
				return</del>. <add>are of the past FOREVER!</add> The SPOOKS of Darkness, of Fear,
				of Superstition and Ignorance can never return to obstruct our progress into the
				DAWN of TO-MORROW.</p>
			<p>
				<emph rend="underline">But we can not rest with TO-DAY.</emph> We must move ONWARD.
				Unless <del>at the same</del> time they <del>are</del>
				<add>be</add> preparations for the creation of a better world TO-MORROW, all
				attempts to solve the social problems which press upon the consciousness of the
				world to-day are <emph rend="underline">futile</emph>. You can pour out <emph
					rend="underline">millions</emph> and <emph rend="underline">BILLIONS</emph> in
				an unending Niagara to feed the hungry and to give work to the idle and it will be
				wasted, unless–I repeat UNLESS–in so doing you are awakening the innate intelligence
				of <del><gap reason="obliterated"/> the People</del>
				<add>all AMERICAN CITIZENS</add> to direct their own destinies and to create a LIFE
				MORE ABUNDANT for themselves.</p>
			<p> LIFE MORE ABUNDANT can never come until the nation–the whole nation–is awakened to
				the <emph rend="underline">primary</emph>, <emph rend="underline">fundamental</emph>
				and <emph rend="underline">elemental</emph> importance of GOOD BREEDING <add>through
					CONTROL</add>. The wealth of this country–of all <add>any</add> country–can not
				be measured in Dollars, nor in Gold. It can only be estimated in the quality of
				individuals who make it up.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<p> TO-MORROW, therefore, Our Legislators must decide. ARE the <place
					reg="United States">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</place> to go on tacitly
					<add>encouraging</add>
				<del>and</del> by <del>maintaining</del> obstructing <add>perpetuating ARCHAIC
					laws</add> laws on the statute books the BREEDING OF the DEFECTIVE, the
				DELINQUENT and the CRIMINAL? <add>COMPUTE THE COST TO THE NATION</add> this WORK
				must be carried on in every section of the Country that in each Community the
				problem is more pressing that ever before.</p>
			<p> ALL citizens and taxpayers are asked to meet the expenses of relief, to feed the
				hungry, <add>to clothe the poverty-stricken,</add> to <del>employ the</del> give
				work to the unemployed. That is TO-DAY’S Problem. But let us not forget that the
				solution of TODAY’S PROBLEMS may involve us in greater complication’s TO-MORROW.</p>
			<p>
				<add>EVEN if</add> the obstacles confronting us <emph rend="underline">today</emph>
				are so menacing, so threatening, so pressing, be<del>cause</del> even if Emergency
				Measures seem so imperative, VISION MUST NOT PERISH. The BLINDNESS of <emph
					rend="underline">Yesterday</emph> has resulted in the CHAOS of TODAY<add>.</add>
				BUt the VERY CONFUSION OF TODAY should make us more keenly conscious than ever of
				our DUTY to TOMORROW, <del>makes a we wish</del> to The respect and gratitude of the
				Children of To-Morrow and the day after Tomorrow we <add>can earn today</add> only
				by demonstrating for future historians that despite the World Tragedy into which we
				have been <del>precipitated</del>
				<add>HURLED</add> by the Stubborn and Wanton Ignorance of <emph rend="underline"
					>Yesterday</emph>, <del>we have held</del>
				<gap/> despite the stumbling of our feet along the steep and rocky battlefield, we
					<add>have</add> managed to hold aloft the tattered banner of intelligence–have
				indeed carried forward still brightly burning the <add>SACRED</add> TORCH OF
				LIFE.</p>
