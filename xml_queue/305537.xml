		<head>A Review by Margaret Sanger: Little Essays of Love and Virtue</head>
		<p>It is with characteristic modesty that <person reg="Ellis, Havelock">Havelock
				Ellis</person> gives to the present volume the title of "<title type="book">Little
				Essays</title>." They deserve to be named "Great Essays"; and every husband and
			wife, every father and mother, should be compelled to read them. They reveal their
			author in all the deepened ripeness of his wisdom. To the readers of the <title
				type="journal">BIRTH CONTROL REVIEW</title> some of them may be familiar, as we have
			published them in pamphlet form. But they are worthy of more than one reading. They
			should be studied and read over and over again; for each new reading will throw fresh
			light on life's fundamental and unchanging problems. For, as Havelock Ellis points out
			in his preface, "<q who="ELLHA">the art of making love and the art of being virtuous
				remain indeed, when we cease to misunderstand them, essentially the same in all ages
				and among all peoples.</q>" If we are really alive, he also says, we flexibly adjust
			ourselves to the world in which we find ourselves; and, in so doing, simultaneously
			adjust to ourselves that ever-changing world, ever-changing, though its changes are
			within such narrow limits that it yet remains substantially the same.</p>
		<p>The first essay is entitled "<title type="article">Children and Parents</title>," and in
			it, as always, Havelock Ellis brings new and suggestive light to an eternal problem.
			Invigorating is his fine absence of sentimentality and pretty platitude, in dealing with
			a problem that has been almost lost in the maze of the irrelevant. His conclusion may
			give a hint of the rest: "<q who="ELLHA">Childhood is simply a preparation for the free
				activities of later life. Parents exist in order to equip children for life, not to
				shelter and protect them from the world into which they must sooner or later be
				cast</q>." Whatever else it should or should not be, he warns us, education must be
			an inoculation against the poisons of life, and an adequate equipment in knowledge and
			skill for meeting the chances of life. Beyond that, and no doubt in the largest part, it
			is a natural growth and takes place of itself. How refreshing these words in a day when
			unbiased theories and illusions are almost universally prevalent!</p>
		<p>How courageous--the quiet calm courage of one who is speaking eternal truth--are these
			lines from the essay on "<title type="article">The Meaning of Purity:</title>" "<q
				who="ELLHA">When Love is suppressed, Hate takes its place. The least regulated
				orgies of Love grow innocent beside the orgies of Hate. When nations that might well
				worship one another cut one another's throats, when Cruelty and Self-Righteousness
				and Lying and all the Powers of Destruction rule the human heart, the world is
				devastated, the fiber of the whole organization of society grows flaccid, and all
				the ideals of civilization are debased . . .</q>" And the cure for the present
			undying orgy of Hatred? Here is the answer:--"<q who="ELLHA">It is more passion and ever
				more that we need if we are to undo the work of Hate, if we are to add to the gaiety
				and splendor of life, to the sum of human achievement, to the aspiration of human
				ecstasy. The things that fill men and women with beauty and exhilaration, and spur
				them to actions beyond themselves, are the things that are now needed . . . It is
				only in the passion of facing the naked beauty of the world and its naked truth that
				we can win intrinsic beauty . . . It is only the metals that can be welded in the
				fire of passion to finer services that the world needs. It would be well that the
				rest should be lost in these flames. That indeed would be a world fit to perish
				wherein the moralist had set up the ignoble maxim: 'Safety first.'</q>"</p>
		<p>One is tempted to go on quoting and quoting, so many illuminating truths strike the eyes
			as one turns the pages of this book which is small only in material size. Birth Control
			is ably defended in a number of the essays, and, in what is perhaps the most
			challenging, arresting and valuable contribution--the essay entitled "<title
				type="article">The Play Function of Sex</title>,"--upon the highest ethical and
			aesthetic basis. There is never anything materialistic nor prosaic in Havelock Ellis's
			conception of sex. Yet as he points out, we nowhere enter the realm of the spiritual
			save through the material. And so "<q who="ELLHA">eye-glasses and contraceptive alike
				are a portal to the spiritual world for many who, without them, would find that
				world largely a closed book.</q>" And not that least gain from the practice of Birth
			Control, as we cannot too often reiterate and emphasize, is that it effects finally the
			complete liberation of the spiritual object of marriage. Lovers--he speaks here with a
			wisdom that is deeply and divinely inspired--pass to each other "<q who="ELLHA">the
				sacramental chalice of that wine which imparts the deepest joy that men and women
				can know. They are subtly weaving the invisible cords that bind husband and wife
				together more truly and more firmly than the priest of any church. And if in the
				end,--as may be or may not be--they attain the climax of free and complete union,
				then their human play has become one with that divine play of creation in which the
				old poets fabled that, out of the dust of the ground and in his own image, some God
				of Chaos once created man.</q>"</p>
		<p>And so finally and fittingly Havelock Ellis permits us to share with him his vision of
			the Future, quoting that noble fore-runner who envisaged the world as the quarry
			stretching out before some master-builder. Everything that lies outside of us is only
			the material on which we may and must exercise our creative and constructive powers. And
			everything inside of us is also the material out of which we must create the Future of
			our world. "<q who="ELLHA">Deep within lies the creative force which is able to form
				what it will and gives us no rest until, without us or within us, in one or the
				other way, we have given it representation.</q>"</p>
		<p>The vistas that are opened up, comments Havelock Ellis, when we realize the direction in
			which the human race is traveling, may seem to be endless. Man has found that he is
			himself a God who . . . himself created the world as he sees it, and now has even
			acquired the power of creating himself, or rather, of recreating himself.</p>
		<p>No book published in recent years can do more towards educating the general American
			public in the philosophic and spiritual background of Birth Control than these "<title
				type="book">Little Essays of Love and Virtue.</title>" Every cultivated person,
			especially every active friend of the movement must arm himself or herself with this
			illuminating, courageous and inspiring book. Widely read, it will increase the army of
			our adherents manyfold.</p>
