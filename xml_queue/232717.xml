		<head>MESSAGE TO THE 2nd. <org reg="All-India Conference on Family Planning, 2nd">ALL INDIA
				CONFERENCE ON FAMILY PLANNING</org></head>
		<p>To Lady Rama Rau and Friends of the <org>Family Planning Association of India</org></p>
		<p>Kindly convey to the delegates and co-workers of the F.P.A. of India my compliments and
			congratulations for the splendid accomplishments of the past two years.</p>
		<p>I regret that I can not be with you for your second national meeting to congratulate in
			person the accomplishments as a result of hard work and consecrated devotion.</p>
		<p>What <place>India</place> has accomplished relative to family planning centers and the
			spread of this educational reform has been a great surprise and inspiration to many of
			us who have labored through the years. What has taken us twenty years to accomplish,
			India has done in two years. Yours is the first <org reg="India Government"
				>Government</org> to have contributed to the spread of this work, and now with
			reports from some of your scientists in the scientific laboratories they are on their
			way to develop simple cheap contraceptives, which is indeed much to be desired. And
			again my congratulations and hearty best wishes for the continued success of your work
			and the worldwide inspiration that your Family Planning Association of India has give to
			us all. </p>
