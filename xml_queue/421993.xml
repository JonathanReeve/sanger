		<head>Margaret Sanger Carries on Crusade for Health and Peace through
			Birth Control</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">A dauntless crusader was guest in our town last
					week--a woman who never quivered at the clang of the police
					gong, who took misunderstanding, humiliation and jail in
					stride--Margaret Sanger, advocate of birth control.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">And whether you agree or disagree with her ideas,
					you must admire the courage that, undaunted, could go on
					year after year until the tide of public opinion changed and
					brought honors in place of scorn and the respect of
					statesmen as well as the idolatry of the women of the poor,
					for a cause that is still a matter of controversy.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">We met Mrs. Sanger the other day at luncheon,
					after a lapse of 17 years. The hair that once was a coppery
					fluff was silver but the blue eyes with their zealot's light
					were the same. And so we knew before we heard her speak that
					Margaret Sanger was still in the ring battling for liberated
					mothers, for better childhood, for controlled populations,
					for peace and a more civilized world. For in her mind and in
					those of thousands of others, birth control, peace and
					civilization are inexorably linked.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Start of Career</head>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">Before we tell you some of the things Mrs. Sanger
					said at the joint luncheon of the <place
						reg="San Francisco, CA">San Francisco</place> Center of
					the <org>League of Women Voters</org>, the local branch of
					the <org>American Association of University Women</org> and
					the <org>Family Relations Center</org>, we must go back to
					the beginnings of a career that parallels those of other
					deeply beloved feminist leaders.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">Following a college education, she studied
					nursing at a <place reg="White Plains, NY">White Plains, New
						York</place> hospital. To this she added a post graduate
					course at the <org><place reg="New York, NY"
							>Manhattan</place> Eye and Ear Hospital</org>. With
					this background she plunged into volunteer nursing in the
					East Side tenements of Manhattan. Even after her marriage to
						<person reg="Sanger, William">William Sanger</person>,
					New York artist, she continued her social service work and
					it was through her experiences in trying to aid the pitiful
					mothers of the poor, that her ideas crystallized and her
					tremendous reform movement was begun.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Battle With Death</head>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">In her reminiscence, <gap extent="two words"
						reason="missing"/> going to aid the <person
						reg="Sachs, Sadie">mother of a destitute family</person>
					who had tried to stop the coming of another child. For days
					and nights "Nurse" Sanger fought a battle with death and
					won. Hardly was the fight over than she was called again in
					the same tenement, but this time she arrived just in time to
					close the eyes of a dying woman.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">Returning sadly to her home where her husband and
					her own three children were peacefully asleep, she stood at
					her window until dawn visioning thousands of
					poverty-stricken mothers, facing more and more births and
					then death.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"I decided then I was through with nursing broken bodies," <q
					who="ESTZI">she related in after years. </q>"I was
				determined to strike at the root of the evil, to save the bodies
				before they were broken."</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Launches Campaign</head>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">And so she gave up her work in the tenements to
					launch, in a contrary world, a move to make available to all
					women asking it, information that would permit them to
					regulate the size of their families. And what a bitter
					battle she precipitated.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">For years she devoted herself to writing,
					lecturing and organizing the <org>American Birth Control
						League</org>. Over and over again she was hauled from
					her platform and hurried off to face the law. But nothing
					could stop her. And gradually the strong silent sentiment
					that grew up in support of her theories became vocal and
					under <person reg="Wilson, Woodrow">President
						Wilson</person>'s administration, the hounds of the law
					were called off. </q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">How this work has grown is indicated by the fact
					that California has just organized a <org
						reg="California State Federation of Birth Control Leagues"
						>State Federation of Birth Control Leagues</org> with
					some 24 units as a starter.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Many Now Approve</head>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">And now in a world depressed with economic
					problems and faced with a war of nations fighting for space
					for their overflowing populations, Margaret Sanger's ideas
					have the approval not only of social workers, and the great
					feminist organizations such as the League of Women Voters,
					the <org>Business and Professional Women's Clubs</org>, and
					the American Association of University Women, but of
					statesmen.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">Figures cited by her at a luncheon Thursday at
					the Western Women's Club under auspices of a group of the
					leading women's groups showed that the World war was caused
					by <place>Germany</place>'s need for territory to provide
					for her increasing population. Similar conditions in
					Germany, <place>Italy</place>, and <place>Japan</place>
					today, she said, make another conflict almost
					inevitable.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">A Bar to Peace</head>
			<p>"<place>Italy</place> and <place>Germany</place> have spawned
				themselves into another world conflict," <q who="ESTZI">she
					said.</q> "I believe there will never be world peace in this
				world until a definite population policy is formed."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">As to the situation in the <place>United
						States</place>, Mrs. Sanger pointed to the fact that 65
					per cent of the 2,000,000 babies born in the United States
					last year were in families on relief. Women of the more
					affluent class have access to information that permits them
					to space their children, she said, and it is only among the
					desperately poor that children are brought into the world
					faster then they can be cared for. Of the 2,000,000 more
					than 75,000 were still-born and 69,000 died in their first
					month of life. This mortality, public health reports
					indicated, is due to the lack of vitality of the mothers,
					due to overwork and too frequent maternity, she said.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Public Health Burden</head>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">With a large percentage of children coming from
					families least able to care for and educate them, the public
					health problem of the United States is growing by leaps and
					bounds, Mrs. Sanger said. The latest demand is for
					$85,000,000 for increased services under the national health
					program.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="ESTZI">These tremendous national burdens could be
					avoided if the information were available to the poor
					through clinics and health centers that the well-to-do
					receive through other sources.</q>
			</p>
			<p>"We are breeding now from the 25 per cent of our population that
				has an intelligence level of 15 years of age or less,"<q
					who="ESTZI"> she said.</q> "If we could deal with this
				subject as a public health problem in 25 years we would see a
				great change in the intelligence ratio of our country, and we
				could build for quality among our people and for peace."</p>
