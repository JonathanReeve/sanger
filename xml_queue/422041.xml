		<head>EDITORIAL COMMENT</head>
		<p>The appeal in the case of <person reg="Mindell, Fania">Fania Mindell</person> has been
			won. Miss Mindell was arrested in the <org reg="Brownsville Clinic">Brownsville birth
				control clinic</org> for selling <title type="book">"What Every Girl Should
				Know,"</title> Margaret Sanger's book on sex hygiene. By a 2 to 1 vote, the <org
				reg="New York City Court of Special Sessions">Court of Special Sessions</org>
			declared this book to be "indecent," Judges <person reg="Hermann, Moses">Herman</person>
			and <person reg="O'Keefe, George J.">O'Keefe</person> voting for conviction and <person
				reg="Freschi, John J.">Judge Freschi</person> for acquittal. The forces of reaction
			were bolstered up by <person reg="Cropsey, James C.">Judge James C. Cropsey,</person> of
			the <org reg="New York State Supreme Court">Supreme Court,</org> who went out of his way
			to declare that the information in the book was what "<q who="CROJA">no girl should
				know</q>." Yet the reversal of judgment accorded by the <org
				reg="New York State Court, Appellate Division">Appellate Division</org> was by an
			unanimous vote. This victory was of great importance, because several other persons who
			had been arrested for selling "<title type="book">What Every Girl Should Know</title>,"
			and whose cases were being held in abeyance, had the charges against them dismissed as
			soon as the final verdict was rendered in the Mindell appeal. The latter cost several
			hundred dollars in fees for records, copies of the minutes, printing bills, etc. But it
			goes without saying that under our present system of justice no compensation has been
			awarded to those who financed the appeal. To date, the Court has not even refunded the
			$50, which Fania Mindell was, by its own admission, wrongly fined. Once again it has
			been proved that it takes money to obtain "justice," and that the workers cannot
			possibly afford to appeal cases.</p>
		<p><place reg="New York">New York</place> has just enfranchised more than 3,000,000 women.
			The ardent, self-sacrificing workers who devoted years of their lives to bringing this
			result about deserve the highest praise and the gratitude of their sex. After their long
			fight, they can now enjoy the fruits of victory. But only too large a proportion of
			those they have set free politically will be quite unable to take advantage of the vote
			that has been so dearly earned. There are hundreds of thousands of mothers who are so
			submerged beneath the burdens of child-bearing that they will not have the time even to
			cast their vote, much less to take an intelligent interest in the problems of society.
			Surely the next step is to set these women free. Birth control is the fundamental
			liberty which they must have. We appeal to the new women citizens of New York State to
			assist us in waging the battle which now takes pre-eminence--that for the repeal of laws
			preventing the dissemination of birth control knowledge.</p>
		<p>The war has taken the best energies of most radical and forward movements. Persons who
			formerly were willing to work for the advancement of humanity are now devoting all their
			strength to the world tragedy. But there are still some of us who believe birth control
			to be a fundamental solution to the problems of poverty, prostitution, child labor and
			even war itself. The intolerance of our public censors prevents us from being very
			active on the platform or in the press, at least until peace is restored. But there is
			one way in which we can use this dark period of repression to serve the future of the
			movement. We can do definite and constructive work by gathering data so convincing that
			the Legislature of New York State will be unable to ignore the demand for the repeal of
			Section 1142. <person reg="Whitman, Charles S.">Governor Whitman</person> promised last
			Spring to appoint a commission to investigate the conditions bearing upon birth control,
			but the war has delayed this official action for the present. The thing for us who are
			still devoted to our cause to do, is to hasten the appointment of the commission by
			preparing the material on which it must work. Were we, for instance, to collect the
			histories of</p>
		<list>
			<item>5,000 women living in prostitution,</item>
			<item>5,000 women toiling in factories,</item>
			<item>5,000 children toiling in mills,</item>
			<item>5,000 inmates of prisons,</item>
			<item>5,000 derelicts of poorhouses,</item>
		</list>
		<p>and show what percentage of these people come from large families, so searching a light
			would be thrown on this new angle of social betterment that the Governor's commission
			would be stimulated into action and the benighted laws against birth control would be
			wiped off the statute books. The editors of this magazine would be glad to hear from
			readers in all parts of the country willing to help either by contributing to an
			investigation fund or by volunteering their time and services for research work.</p>
		<p>The justices of the Supreme Court of New York State receive $17,500 a year. On this
			pitiable salary, it is, of course, unreasonable to expect them to put in much time on
			writing opinions which would serve to explain their frequently obscure acts to the
			public that pays them. For instance, when the Appellate Division, First Department,
			decided to uphold the Commissioner of Licenses as against <person reg="Bijur, Nathan"
				>Judge Bijur,</person> in connection with the <name type="film" reg="Birth Control"
				>birth control photoplay</name>, they made absolutely no comment. The scholarly
			document in which Judge Bijur demonstrated that the film was not immoral was thrown out
			of court with the rubber-stamp comment, "Decision reversed." Again, when "<title
				type="book">What Every Girl Should Know</title>" won the right to be circulated, the
			Court merely O.K.'d it as being "decent," without handing down a written opinion which
			would have served as a precedent in future appeals for the right to print the truth.
			Similar books will have to go through the same ridiculous procedure, and unwind the same
			red tape which one strong, intelligent opinion would have cut for good and all.</p>
