		<head>SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR JAPAN'S FUTURE POPULATIONS STUDIES</head>
		<byline>By Margaret Sanger</byline>
		<p>There is an urgent need throughout the world to form an accurate picture of factors
			causing the rapid increase of World Population.</p>
		<p>Each country can cooperate in ascertaining these factors in the hope that eventually the
				<org>United Nations</org> will be instrumental in proposing a plan to its
			constituents that will improve the conditions both in physical health and economically
			for each Nation. Lacking basic data on population problems has prevented an objective
			approach to methods to be applied to solve them. If proper and adequate data relative to
			birth and death rates; attitudes toward and involved in spacing birth of children;
			limitation of size of family; methods of contraception; motivations effecting
			reproductive results. These data could afford a foundation for the formulation of a
			Population Policy, which every country should strive to attain.</p>
		<list>
			<item>1. Set up a plan to extend the next five years of study in population
				problems.</item>
			<item>2. Compile facts contributing to the high birth rate and population increase of
					<place>Japan</place>.</item>
			<item>3. Set up a Teaching Center Clinic where graduate medical students may have access
				to films, literature, research records, and be taught the correct technique of
				contraception and sterilization.</item>
			<item>4. Recommend that an educational program by instituted by Government agencies
				covering hospitals, Public Health groups, and Welfare agencies.</item>
			<item>5. Investigate latest Research studies both chemical and mechanical, and recommend
				wide distribution of these methods most suitable to individual conditions throughout
				the country.</item>
			<item>6. All of the above should aim to be instrumental within two years in helping to
				form a basis for the inauguration of a Population Advisory Board, consisting of
				National experts in the studies of Demography, Population, Biology, Agriculture,
				Soil Conditions, Medical and Physiological experts. </item>
