		<head>HEALTH</head>
		<p>The health &amp; well being of more than 45 <add>million</add> women of child bearing age
			of which 35 million are engaged in that precarious occupation of child bearing &amp; on
			whom the lives of their children &amp; the health &amp; happiness of the family depend
			should be of paramount concern to these officials entrusted with the health &amp;
			welfare of the Nation.</p>
		<p>It should be the object of our Public Health to protect &amp; improve the health &amp;
			well being of this group upon whom the future of our National Citizenship depends.</p>
		<p>From what Stock are we now storing for our future population?</p>
