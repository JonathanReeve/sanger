		<div type="section">
			<p>On my return from a recent tour of several Southern states, I am more than ever
				convinced that it must become a necessary government function to provide birth
				control service through public health agencies to those who cannot afford the
				services of private physicians. Civic officials and leaders of social welfare
				organizations where I visited all regard birth control as the most immediate and
				important step in the solution of the problems of the various blighted areas, to
				halt “human erosion”. Everywhere meetings were overcrowded, not by the curious, not
				by those seeking personal information, but mostly by officials and those actively
				working among the indigent and the unfit, who sought knowledge and a fresh viewpoint
				for constructive social work.</p>
			<p>In one community I visited, 50% of the total area was designated as blighted”, yet
				this area contains 54% of the population, 58% of the child population 10 years of
				age and under, 67% of the white and 83% of the children appearing in <org>Juvenile
					Court</org>s on delinquency charges, 82% of the relief clients, 80% of the
				tuberculosis cases, 70% of the infant and maternal mortality among the white
				population, and 90% among the colored. This is the area of poor housing, inadequate
				income, dependency and disease. Yet this area is only one of thousands throughout
				the nation. Any slum section of New York or <place reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</place>
				would reveal the same conditions, in practically the same proportion, creating
				similar problems.</p>
			<p>While it is true that the <org reg="United States Government">Federal
					Government</org> is spreading out its protective hands and building new homes
				for the occupants in these slum sections, it is the consensus of opinion that
				environment alone will not change the habits of this population, and within 10
				years, with their unchecked potency for child-bearing, there will naturally be an
				extension of the problem, and an even greater tax burden placed upon the small
				portion of the population left to pay the bills.</p>
			<p>It is now known that 13 of the Southern States have populations of which over 97% are
				native-born, providing an unparalleled opportunity for a reconstruction program to
				improve not only the environment but the innate quality of our national life. Here
				indeed is material to excite the imagination.</p>
			<p> I found nothing but the most receptive attitude on the part of the people themselves
				towards receiving birth control advice, and also I found the will to give this
				service among those in closest touch with the human need. But obstacles come from
				the top, from a few officials and arrogant clergymen who set their wills against
				public good, and intimidate nurses, social workers, and medical agencies from
				providing this service to parents who vainly ask it. It is at their doors that the
				increasing human misery in these groups must be laid. They are trying to solve 20th
				century problems with the dogma of the dark ages, and men and women everywhere must
				refuse them this power.</p>
			<p>Very soon there will be a request made to <org reg="United States Congress"
					>Congress</org> by the Federal Government for a new appropriation of
				$850,000,000 to improve public health. No doubt a large portion of this huge sum
				asked of the tax-payers, will be sought to increase existing health and welfare
				services for mothers and children. No greater service could be given to the mothers
				and to the children among that enormous group of 20,000,000 individuals dependent
				upon some form of public aid, than to provide birth control knowledge to enable them
				to help themselves by not adding to their own misery through increasing the number
				who must share it. In 1937, out of the 2,000,000 babies born in this country,
				1,100,000 were born to parents on relief with incomes of less than $1000 a year.</p>

			<head type="sub">Three Suggestions</head>
			<p>It behooves, therefore, the mean and women who have the welfare of the future of this
				country at heart to ask, nay to demand, of their Representatives in Congress, that
				included in the provisions of this legislation must be the right of these parents to
				obtain birth control information through health agencies supported by public funds.
				Such a measure will not only give constructive, immediate relief to millions of
				families, and prevent additional suffering, but would be the greatest forward step
				ever taken on a national scale to raise the level of intelligence of the nation’s
				population, and the quality of life.</p>
			<p>There are two other suggestions I would like to make: (1) Throughout the country our
				institutions are overcrowded with the insane, the feeble-minded, and the diseased.
				Thousands of human beings, buried alive, who can contribute nothing to their
				generation other than to use up the vital energies of those who must care for them.
				The cost of maintaining our derelict population is nothing compared to the loss of
				creative effort which might be utilized in other channels. Why should our Benevolent
				Federal Government not make a constructive investment in the quality of our future
				citizenship by offering pensions to all those in the child-bearing age with
				transmissible or hereditary diseases who will agree to sterilization? Here truly is
				a system of pensioning that will bring its own reward.</p>
			<p>Couple this with another appropriation <add>as an aid to marriage</add> for those
				healthy, intelligent young men and women, skilled artisans, professionals,
				agriculturists, who wish to marry and would welcome a family, if only there were
				some provision to tide them through possible emergencies in first few years until
				they could become entirely self-supporting. Money spent of a population of sound
				minds in healthy bodies that must inevitably promote and insure individual and
				national welfare. </p>
