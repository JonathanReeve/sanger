		<head>AT 71, MRS. SANGER SCORES DR. JACOBS</head>
		<byline>By <person reg="Asbury, Edith Evans">EDITH EVANS ASBURY</person></byline>
		<p>
			<q who="NYT">Margaret Sanger, founder of the birth control movement in the <place>United
					States,</place> said yesterday she was</q> "delighted at the leadership taken by
			the different religions in defense of birth control" <q who="NYT">in the controversial
				city hospital policy.</q></p>
		<p>"It comes a little late, but it is never too late," <q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said. She
				was interviewed by telephone on the eve of her seventy-first birthday, which she
				will celebrate today.</q></p>
		<p><q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger lives in <place reg="Tucson, AZ">Tucson, Ariz.,</place> next
				door to her son, <person reg="Sanger, Stuart">Dr. Stuart Sanger</person>. Another
				son, <person reg="Sanger, Grant">Dr. Grant Sanger</person> of <place
					reg="Mount Kisco, NY">Mount Kisco,</place> reached Tucson yesterday to join the
				birthday celebration.</q></p>
		<p><q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said it was time the fight for birth control was not left</q>
			"to those of us in <org reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">Planned
				Parenthood</org> who have been fighting all these years."</p>
		<p><q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger faced strong opposition and was even sentenced to jail, when, as
				a young nurse in <place reg="New York, NY">New York City,</place> she sought to
				disseminate birth control information.</q></p>
		<p><q who="NYT">She was moved to action by dismay over young mothers in the slums. She said
				they were overburdened by more children than they were physically able to bear or
				care for.</q></p>
		<p>"Laws have changed since then, and public opinion has changed, but the fight must still
			go on, because we still have strong opposition,"<q who="NYT"> she said
			yesterday.</q></p>
		<p>"I am amazed that New York City, where I founded the <org reg="Brownsville Clinic">first
				birth control clinic</org> in the country, is still so backward. I have just come
			back from <place reg="Honolulu, Hawaii">Honolulu,</place> where they have birth control
			therapy in city hospitals. Imagine, more advanced than New York!"</p>
		<p><q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said she believed that the public airing of the controversy in
				New York City would prove</q> "beneficial to all, including the Catholics." <q
				who="NYT">She described the ban on birth control therapy in city hospitals by
					<person reg="Jacobs, Morris A.">Dr. Morris A. Jacobs,</person> Commissioner of
				Hospitals, as a </q> "disgraceful policy."</p>
		<p>"Many Catholics across the country have told me they disapprove of this one position of
			their church,"<q who="NYT"> she said.</q></p>
		<p>"Many of them come to our clinics. A look at statistics will prove that Catholics are
			having smaller families."</p>
		<p><q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger is still active. With the aid of two secretaries she handles
				correspondence from all parts of the world. She is president of the
					<org>International Planned Parenthood Federation</org> and plans to go to the
				organization's <org reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 6th"
					>international conference</org> at <place>New Delhi, India,</place> next
				year.</q></p>
		<p><q who="NYT">In her spare time, she paints, concentrating on the deserts and mountains in
				Arizona. She has eight grandchildren. Six are the children of Dr. Grant Sanger and
				his <person reg="Sanger, Edwina">wife</person>.</q></p>
