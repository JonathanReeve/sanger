		<head>DICTATORS SEEN AS NEARSIGHTED BY MRS. SANGER</head>
		<div>
			<p> “Dictators have no use for birth control because they are near-sighted,” <q
					who="NYWT">said <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> today,
					shaking her roan colored hair.</q> “They seem to realize that constantly
				increasing populations are potentially the strongest cause of war.” </p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYWT">Mrs. Sanger, vivacious and good-humored after 21 years of fighting for
					the spreading of knowledge about birth control, today accepted an invitation
					from the <org reg="All-India Women's Conference">All India Women’s
						Conference</org> and plans to sail next month to establish clinics and
					bureaus in <place>India</place>. </q></p>

		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub"> Real Basis for War. </head>
			<p> “As a result of unlimited increase in population in <place>Italy</place>,” <q
					who="NYWT">said Mrs. Sanger,</q> “<person reg="Mussolini, Benito"
					>Mussolini</person> is eager to gain new colonial territory in
					<place>Africa</place> for his overflow. That’s the real basis for the Ethiopian
				situation.”</p>

			<p><q who="NYWT">Mrs. Sanger told her plans at the office of the <org>National Committee
						on Federal Legislation for Birth Control</org>.</q>
			</p>

			<p> “We’re getting ahead fast,” <q who="NYWT">she said.</q> “In the future, and not very
				far into the future either, birth control will be effective through immunization. It
				will run for a half year depending on the dosage, just as small pox is staved off.
				But we still have a long way to go. “ </p>

			<head type="sub"> India’s Population Jumped. </head>
			<p> “The population of India jumped from 318,000,000 in 1921 to 352,000,000 in 1931. And
				they still kill girl babies and many widows still commit suicide on their husband’s
				funeral pyres. What is to become of poor India? Well, I’ll see about that.”</p>

			<p><q who="NYWT"> Mrs. Sanger disclosed that records of the <org
						reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">New York clinic</org> show that
					of the thousands of persons who asked for birth control guidance there had been
					only two per cent of failure for technical reasons and five percent for human
					reasons in the system taught.</q>
