				<q who="SLT">Mrs. Margaret Sanger of <place reg="New York, NY">New York,</place> the
					militant advocate of birth control, who failed to deliver her scheduled lecture
					at the Victoria Theater Monday night, said Tuesday she would remain in St. Louis
					an extra day in order to lecture at a public hall. Heading a throng of 1200, she
					pounded vainly upon the outer doors for admission to the Victoria Monday night,
					but the house remained "dark." She attempted to speak from her automobile, but,
					on advice of the counsel, stopped when <person reg="Silverman, Sergeant">Sergt.
						Silverman</person> gave her two minutes</q> "<q who="SILSE">to cease or
					submit to arrest.</q>" </p>
			<p>
				<q who="SLT">At Hotel Jefferson Tuesday Mrs. Sanger said she would sue the
					management of the theater for $5000 and would remain in St. Louis another day in
					order to deliver her public lecture, which she declared would be given in some
					hall to be announced later. Mrs. Sanger spoke at noon at the <org

					evening at the <org reg="St. Louis Town Club">Town Club.</org></q>
			</p>
			<p><q who="SLT">Mrs. Sanger declared Tuesday the treatment accorded her Monday night</q>
				"was simply outrageous."</p>
			<p>"My acquittal in New York is proof that my lectures are within the law. My itinerary
				required that I leave St. Louis Tuesday night, but I will remain until Thursday to
				deliver the public lecture I came here to deliver. Discouraged? Not a bit! This
				objection to my talk by the narrow-minded has only aided our movement and heartened
				me."</p>

					minutes or jail. Mrs. Sanger began to talk. Sergt. Silverman took out his watch.
					Mrs. Sanger talked one minute and 59 seconds, and the lecture was over.</q></p>
