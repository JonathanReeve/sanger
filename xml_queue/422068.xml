		<head>BIRTH CONTROL BY EDUCATION </head>
		<byline>By Mrs. Margaret Sanger (Leader of Birth Control Movement)</byline>
		<div type="section">
			<p>Within the span of a single generation I see birth control established both in public
				opinion as desirable and necessary, and in practice in all strata of society.</p>
			<p>The poor will be helped by means of clinics and public opinion will demand the
				sterilization of those whose progeny would be injurious.</p>
			<p>I base this prediction on the rapid spread of the idea in this country during the
				last eight years since the effort has been made to put forward the propaganda; on
				the tremendous demand that exists for it among women, who are now in possession of
				political power; and on the conclusion, reached by eminent eugenicists, like,
				Professor <person reg="Macbride, Ernest William">E.W. Macbride</person>, by
				economists, like <person reg="Keynes, John Maynard">John Maynard Keynes</person> and
					<person reg="Cox,
		    	Harold">Harold Cox</person>, and by statisticians like
					<person reg="Pollack, Horatio">Horatio Pollack</person>, that only through the
				deliberate restriction of births can society escape the catastrophic which will
				submerge our present civilization.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">A World Question</head>
			<p>The statesmen of the old world are already face to face with the problem. The
				solution of it is at hand, and a few years of clear thinking, under the leadership
				of writers and statesmen, will create a demand for a change in our present
				policy.</p>
			<p>In making this prediction I have also vividly in mind the readiness with which the
				idea of birth control is being accepted in <place>Japan</place>,
					<place>China</place> and <place>India</place>. If China-the home of
				conservatism-can adapt itself to this idea, surely it cannot be long before the
				conservatism of certain groups in the <place>United States</place>,
					<place>England</place> and <place>France</place> is compelled to give way before
				the new forces, which are behind the movement for birth control.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="sub">
			<head type="sub">Purpose of the Movement</head>
			<p>In reply to the question, what is the purpose of birth control? I would say briefly
				that birth control opens the way to a new and better civilization and freer, finer,
				nobler, human race.</p>
			<p>It will free women from their age-long slavery to unwilling motherhood.</p>
			<p>It will insure that each child born into the world shall be welcome, and shall have a
				fair chance at both sound mind and healthy body as well as for adequate support and
				care from its parents, and opportunity in life, in a social system, free from the
				overcrowding of the present day.</p>
		</div>
		<div type="sub">
			<head type="sub">An Educational Move</head>
			<p>It will banish wars--so far as war has been due to over-population and the demand of
				a nation which is strong and aggressive for a place in the sun for its ever
				increasing numbers.</p>
			<p>It will raise the level of living for the workers, for the supply will not be so
				greatly in excess of the demand as to cause unemployment and the crowding down of
				wages.</p>
			<p>It will diminish the burdens of taxation and charity and so release the more thrifty
				members of the community and enable them to sustain their numbers.</p>
			<p>I have no plan for imposing birth control on the nation by law. Our aim is rather to
				sweep away legislation which now prevents access to birth control knowledge.</p>
