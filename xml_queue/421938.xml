		<p><q who="LMA"> Margaret Sanger, noted birth control authority, declared today that if the
				world’s population continues to increase as it is at present it will soon be
				impossible to feed everyone.</q></p>
		<p><q who="LMA"> Mrs. Sanger, in San Francisco as the guest of the <org
					reg="San Francisco Planned Parenthood Committee">planned parenthood
					committee</org>, cited research of the <org
					reg="United States Department of Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</org> to
				back up her startling statement.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="LMA">She said the research shows clearly that a definite amount of land is
				necessary to provide food for a given number of people.</q></p>
		<p><q who="LMA"> For example, she said, the research shows that it requires 200 acres of
				good soil to provide sufficient meat for nine persons daily, and another 100 acres
				to provide 40 children with their daily supply of milk.</q></p>
		<p><q who="LMA"> Mrs. Sanger urged extensive research in birth control as a means of
				avoiding overpopulation and the sociological problems related to it.</q></p>
		<p><q who="LMA"> At an <org
					reg="International Congress on Population and World Resources in Relation to the Family"
					>international conference on population and world resources</org> to be held in
					<place>England</place> in August, Mrs. Sanger will be allowed one day on the
				program to discuss the need for birth control research.</q></p>

		<p>
			<q who="LMA">She said <place>Sweden</place> is far ahead of the rest of the world in
				birth control education, and that <place>Germany</place>, <place>Italy</place> and
					<place>Japan</place> are</q> “in dire need” <q who="LMA">of such
			education</q>.</p>
