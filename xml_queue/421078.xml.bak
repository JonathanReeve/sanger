			<p> “For five minutes my proposal concerning a change in <place reg="United States"
					>U.S.A.</place>’s sixty-year old Birth Control Law was actually elevated to
				law,” <q who="DAGEN">related Mrs. <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret
						Sanger</person>, known over the whole world as the foremost pioneer for
					Birth Control, and now on a visit to <place reg="Stockholm, Sweden"
						>Stockholm</place>.</q> “But afterwards an <person reg="McCarran, Patrick"
					>elderly gentleman</person> in the <org reg="United States Senate">Senate</org>
				woke up and protested, and so the work of many years for a change in this vital
				problem was stopped for the time being. But next year it will go through.”</p>
			<q who="DAGEN">
				<p> Mrs. Sanger, who is traveling in <place>Europe</place> with the intention of
					starting an international movement for organized Birth Control, and has now
					arrived in Stockholm, is a lady with a gallant and tumultuous past. And that she
					did little on her own part to avoid the storms one can see immediately in her
					red Irish hair and clear blue American eyes. She has been called America’s most
					slandered woman, and that is quite correct. To begin a campaign for legalized
					birth control twenty-five years ago in America must have been a task with many
					risks. Between 1921, when she called together the first <org
						reg="American Birth Control Conference, 1st">Birth Control Conference</org>
					in America, and now, when her proposition became law, if only for five minutes,
					lie many defeats and many personal persecutions, but also many glorious
					victories. Her first step on the way to which her experience as a child in a
					large and poor family drove her was an article in her own paper, “<title
						type="journal">The Woman Rebel</title>,” which was followed immediately by a
					commitment. She eluded the action by escaping to <place>England</place>, and
					when, a year later she returned to the United States, such a strong European
					opinion stood back of her that the authorities found it advisable to forget the
					little incident of by-gone days. Nevertheless, since then she has served a
					month’s imprisonment. </p>

			<head type="sub"> Birth Control the Only Way to Peace</head>
			<p> “To me it was quite clear,” <q who="DAGEN">she declares,</q> “that now since all the
				countries have closed their boundaries to other nations the only solution to the
				problem of peace is control of population. If you do not choose this method, there
				is only one other, a lowering of the standard of living. And the end is that women
				become the slaves of militarism, that the countries need colonies, the colonies new
				soldiers for their defense, and so on, in one vicious circle."</p>
			<p> “In America, as I said, the law on this question is 60 years old and has never been
				changed. As a consequence of this we have the highest percentage of deaths in
				childbirth in the whole world. Thanks to the somewhat varying laws of the different
				states we have finally come so far that we have nearly 140 more or less officially
				tolerated clinics for birth control information, of which one is mine, and in my
				work I have had occasion to help 50,000 women. But much still needs to be done, and
				that is why I am making this trip. I shall go to <place reg="Soviet Union"
					>Russia</place> to study their organizations for women and how they solve the
				problem home--work. But before this I shall meet with some of my friends here in
				order to talk with them and form a group to continue work. From <place>India</place>
				an inquiry has also come asking I will come there and take part in a <org
					reg="All-India Woman's Conference">congress</org> which represents 11 million
				women. And, as I said, the next time my proposed law concerning permission from
				doctors and other medical scientists to render positive enlightenment regarding
				Birth Control comes up, I believe it will be difficult to count the minutes of its
				duration.”</p>
			<q who="DAGEN">
				<p> Wednesday, at one o’clock at Moseback there will be a meeting between Mrs.
					Sanger and Swedish doctors and others who are interested.</p>
