		<head>MRS. SANGER FLAYS <person reg="Davis, Katharine Bement">MISS DAVIS'S'S</person>
			PLANS</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Mrs. Margaret Sanger, her term of thirty days’ imprisonment over, left
					the Queens County Jail yesterday bringing with her what she calls a "message in
					trust" for the women of <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place> from the
					women of the jail. The message has nothing to do with birth control, advocacy of
					which sent Mrs. Sanger to jail, but, according to Mrs. Sanger, charges of
					studied cruelty and heartlessness in the treatment of the jail’s population.
					Throughout the message occurs frequently the name of Katherine B. Davis, former
					Commissioner of Correction and now Chairman of the Parole Board.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger says she has determined to deliver her message at the
					meeting next Tuesday of the <org>Women’s City Club</org>, which she has been
					invited to address and of which Miss Davis is an officer. Miss Davis may not be
					present, but Mrs. Sanger hopes she will. Miss Davis was out of town yesterday,
					and so an outline of the charges which Mrs. Sanger will make in her public
					address could not be submitted to her.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT"> Mrs. Sanger, however, says she does not intend to make any campaign
					against Miss Davis. She merely regards herself, she explained yesterday, as the
					spokesman of the inmates of the Queens County Jail--</q>"poor girls"<q who="NYT"
					>Mrs. Sanger calls them.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">An Atmosphere of Resentment</head>
			<p>"It is not of physical conditions that the girls complained," <q who="NYT"> said Mrs.
					Sanger, in her home, 246 West Fourteenth Street, after an enthusiastic crowd of
					her friends and sympathizers had met her at the jail and carried her off to a
					luncheon, at the <org>Hotel Lafayette</org>, in celebration of her freedom.</q>
				"It is not of these conditions, though certainly they are sufficiently bad. It is
				the attitude adopted towards the girls, the atmosphere in which they are compelled
				to live." </p>
			<p>"These are such that every inmate of the jail learns to hate Miss Davis with a
				bitterness and a depth of resentment that one would scarcely believe possible. Do
				you know that she cannot enter the men’s mess hall? She has tried on one or two
				occasions and each time has been greeted with cries of 'Get out. Get out.' A keeper
				told me that, and he told me that Miss Davis got out, too." </p>
			<p>"The girls complain that Miss Davis delights in the exercise of authority that
				amounts to tyranny. For instance, one girl learned that her family, her child and
				her mother, had been made destitute by her imprisonment, which had deprived them of
				her support. She pleaded with Miss Davis to release her. Her sentence was an
				indeterminate one and its length was entirely at the pleasure of Miss Davis. Miss
				Davis laughed at her request and then the girl begged at least to be told about how
				long she must remain in jail so that she might, if it were possible, make
				arrangements to tide over matters until her release."</p>
			<p>"<q who="DAVKA">'That’s one of the beauties of the system--that you don’t know,'</q>
				Miss Davis replied."</p>
			<p>"The poor girl told me the whole story. Another begged that her parents be not
				informed of her plight, and she told me that Miss Davis replied: <q who="DAVKA">'Ha!
					Ha! You should have thought of that before you got in here.'</q>"</p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">In Contrast with <org reg="Sing Sing Correctional Facility">Sing
					Sing.</org></head>
			<p>"It was Miss Davis who put up a fine mesh screen in the visiting room so that an
				inmate can see her callers only through a veil so fine that their features are
				scarcely distinguishable. Yet in Sing Sing a convict may receive visitors in a
				comfortable room, where both may be at their ease. Miss Davis removed the knives and
				forks and crockery and replaced the crockery with tin and agate ware. She did not
				replace the knives and forks at all, so that now, if you are unfortunate enough to
				be an inmate, you may tear your meat apart, when you get it, with your fingers. Miss
				Davis has taken away privileges that the inmates fought for years to obtain. Her
				idea of prison management and of reform for prisoners seem to be a discipline so
				harsh and unfeeling that every decent emotion of her victim is killed by it."</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger said another girl, heartbroken, had told her how a member
					of the <org reg="New York State Division of Parole">Parole Board</org> had gone
					to the trouble of a long journey into <place>Connecticut</place> to tell the
					girl’s mother the whole history of her case; how she had been convicted of theft
					and how she was in jail. Recently, the girl had told Mrs. Sanger, word reached
					her of her mother’s illness, brought on by this news, for the girl had always
					been enabled to keep from her parents all knowledge of her wrongdoing.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Little of her own experiences in jail would find a place in her
					address, Mrs. Sanger said, for she had a not unpleasant time, all things
					considered. Shortage of material had kept the authorities from putting her in
					the sewing squad, and so all she had to do was to care for her cell. <person
						reg="McCann, John">John McCann,</person> the Warden, and <person
						reg="Whittaker, Mary">Matron Whittaker</person>, she said, were kindly,
					humane persons, who made the duties of their offices as little unpleasant to the
					inmates as possible. </q>
			</p>
			<p>“I ought to say that of them,” <q who="New York Times">said Mrs. Sanger,</q> “for
				other prisoners told me that they were the rare exception. But even they would not
				permit me to lecture to the girls. I offered to talk on any subject, but they said
				it was impossible. Just think! And those girls had practically nothing to do. There
				is no provision to educate the prisoners, so that an opportunity for real reform
				work is lost.” </p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Mrs. Sanger’s only real trouble while a prisoner arose over her refusal
					to be fingerprinted. Throughout her stay in jail Warden McCann tried to get her
					to submit, and finally on Monday night two keepers tried to force her to submit.
					They apologized for the necessity of using force, but they persisted, and for
					more than an hour they tried to force Mrs. Sanger’s fingers on to the pad. </q>
			</p>
			<p>"I was bruised and exhausted," <q who="NYT">said Mrs. Sanger,</q> "though they tried
				to be as gentle as they could, and at last they went to ask Mr. McCann if they
				should persist. He told them to do so, but after more resistence they abandoned the
				attempt. I cautioned them that they had no right to lay hands on me." </p>
		</div>
		<div type="section">
			<head type="sub">Warm Greeting from Sympathizers.</head>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">Discussion over this kept Mrs. Sanger in jail an hour and a half
					longer, while some forty persons were waiting for her outside. Meantime <person
						reg="Marion, Kitty">Miss Kitty Marion</person>, an English militant
					suffragette, stood in the prison courtyard and sang suffragette words to the air
					of <title type="song">“The Marseillaise</title>,” the inmates joining in the
					chorus from the windows.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="NYT">A testimonial dinner will be given to Mrs. Sanger and <person
						reg="Byrne, Ethel Higgins">her sister</person> at <org>Terrace Garden</org>
					March 16. She says she will make a lecture tour of the <place
						reg="United States">States</place> between <place reg="New York, NY">New
						York</place> and <place reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</place>.</q>
