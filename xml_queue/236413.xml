		<head>An Authority on Family Life Says: Save War Marriages</head>

		<p><q who="SHE">War marriages made headlines right after <place reg="Pearl Harbor, HI">Pearl
					Harbor</place>, when the marriage rate took a sharp up-swing. They are still
				making headlines, but they are no longer such cheerful ones. Two-thirds of the
				wartime marriages are doomed to end in the divorce courts, according to one
				prediction. Another more conservative estimate is that thirty-eight out of every one
				hundred will fail.</q></p>
		<p><q who="SHE">How many of these marriages can really be salvaged? Margaret Sanger, whose courageous fight for
				birth control has made her name famous throughout the world, has some ideas on the
				subject which she sets forth in an article in <title type="journal"
					>SHE Magazine</title>’s current
				issue.</q></p>
		<p><q who="SHE">Mrs. Sanger has no magic words of advice which can save the marriage born
				solely of war emotion and found in the sober light of afterthought to be completely
				wrong. But she does believe that with the proper effort and cooperation a great many
				war marriages otherwise destined to go on the rocks, can be saved.</q></p>
		<p><q who="SHE">Women should realize that their soldier husbands have become distinct
				individuals, men who are tired of all restraints, apron strings, commands. The don’t
				want to be bossed, or even advised in many cases. Old occupations seem unbelievably
				dull and routine.</q></p>
		<p><q who="SHE">Take the case of Mrs. Bill who became a successful business woman while her
				husband was fighting. She liked it. She didn’t dream Bill would be anything but
				proud and delighted. He wasn’t at all. He wanted her to quit, and was horrified and
				hurt at her earning more than he had at his pre-war job.</q></p>
		<p><q who="SHE">Fortunately, both of them were willing to take advice and consulted Dr.
					<person reg="Burr, Emily T.">Emily T. Burr</person>, Director of the <org
					reg="New York City Vocational Adjustment Bureau">Vocational Adjustment
					Bureau</org> of <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>. Dr. Burr
				suggested that Mrs. Bill continue on at her job but that Bill’s salary take care of
				all routine household expenses. Mrs. Bill could save for that baby they were
				planning to have as soon as they could afford it. This made sense to Bill and a
				quarrel that threatened to break Bill’s spirit and a splendid marriage was
				averted.</q></p>
		<p><q who="SHE">On a train recently Mrs. Sanger talked with a young girl who carried a
				fretful baby. Her husband will return at the war’s end, but not to the appreciation
				he no doubt feels he deserves. She wants that appreciation for herself. She wants to
				be told how noble she has been to bear his child in that overcrowded hospital during
				his absence, to stay home with the baby night after night, scrimping on her
				allotment pay. After all, she argued, Phil was having plenty of excitement mixed in
				with the danger. Unless both give a little, and the girl-wife stops nursing her
				growing resentment, this particular marriage will be among the doomed.</q></p>
		<p><q who="SHE">Frequently couples who have been married only a few weeks before they are
				separated tend to idealize each other during the period of separation, and are both
				completely disillusioned when faced with an average human being. When once they are
				made to realize this they are usually willing to let the other step down from the
				pedestal.</q>
		</p>
		<p><q who="SHE">Marriage is both a concession and a demand; a living thing that is never
				static, even during long absences. If one partner has had a chance to develop and
				grow, it is up to him or her to wait for the other to catch up.</q></p>
		<p><q who="SHE">There are numerous organizations ready to serve the serviceman and to give
				expert advice. He should seek them out when problems seem too great to cope with.
				They may save a marriage!</q></p>
