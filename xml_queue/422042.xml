		<head>Says Birth Control Would Right Wrongs</head>
		<p>
			<q who="ODJ">Birth control, or a knowledge of ways and means of contraception, is to be
				a boon to suffering motherhood, according to <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs.
					Margaret Sanger</person> of <place reg="New York, NY">New York,</place> who is
				in <place reg="Portland, OR">Portland</place> to lecture on the subject.</q></p>
		<p>	<q who="ODJ">Not only is it to relieve women of the burden of bearing too many children,
				but it is to be a large factor in the fight of the poor for economic justice. By
				limiting the birth-rate, birth control advocates say, the supply of cheap labor will
				be diminished and with fewer people, there will be more work and greater
				opportunity.</q></p>
		<p>"Birth control," <q who="ODJ">said Mrs. Sanger, in her apartment at the <org
				reg="Portland Hotel">Portland</org> yesterday,</q> "is the keynote in the social
			awakening. It challenges the idea that women should not try to keep from having children
			and advances the idea that the real wrong is in having children that they do not want,
			and for whom they cannot provide.</p>
		<p>	<q who="ODJ">Mrs. Sanger says that birth control already is practiced by perhaps
				one-third of the women in the <place>United States</place> judging from the birth
				rate.</q>
		</p>
		<p>	<q who="ODJ">Mrs. Sanger was formerly a nurse, and she says it was her work among the
				poor of New York that made her an advocate of birth control.</q></p>
