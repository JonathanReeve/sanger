		<head>MRS. SANGER RAPS RELIEF ACTIVITIES</head>
		<div type="section">
			<p> “It is an outrage on public decency, and a breach of faith with the taxpayers,” <q
					who="IS">Margaret Sanger, president of the <org>National Committee on Federal
						Legislation for Birth Control</org>, said yesterday in commenting on actions
					of relief agencies. These agencies, she said, are encouraging an increase in the
					birth rate in the families of the unemployed by telling mothers that they will
					have a quicker consideration if they can report a condition of
				pregnancy.</q></p>

			<head type="sub">Masses Lose Confidence</head>
			<p>“It has become apparent to every thinking individual that the masses have lost
				confidence in the new deal and in our present paternalistic administration,” she
				said. “The problem that confronts the country is much more complicated than turning
				out one set of politicians or bringing in another: the men in power refuse to face
				facts, and one pertinent fact is that improved machinery has reduced the number of
				workers needed for production.”</p>

			<p>
				<q who="IS">Mrs. Sanger is the leader of the largest birth control clinic in the
					world in <place reg="New York, NY">New York city</place> and has established
					headquarters in <place reg="Washington, DC">Washington</place> for the birth
					control committee on Federal legislation which seeks to make it legal to send
					birth control literature through the <place>United States</place> mails.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q who="IS">Mrs. Sanger is in <place reg="Indianapolis, IN">Indianapolis</place> to
					address the Indianapolis Open Forum tonight on “<title type="article">Birth
						Control: A World-Wide Need</title>,” at 8:15 o’clock at the <org reg="Kirshbaum Community Center">Kirshbaum
						Center.</org></q>
