		<head>City Club Stirred By Mrs. Sanger</head>
		<div>

			<p>
				<q who="CPD">Mrs. Margaret Sanger’s lecture on birth control at the <org
						reg="Cleveland City Club">City Club</org> yesterday so moved an Episcopal
					minister, Rev. <person reg="Hauck, Franklin E.">Franklin E. Hauck</person> of
						<place reg="Bellevue, OH">Bellevue, O.</place>, a club member, that he
					submitted a motion that the club endorse Mrs. Sanger’s program for revision of
					the federal statutes to make legal the distribution of information on birth
					control.</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				<q who="CPD">Dr. <person reg="Thomas, John J.">J. J. Thomas</person>, president of
					the club, said the motion would not come to a vote and went on with the question
					and answer session which followed the lecture. Another club member, however,
					shouted that those present should at least vote that</q> “<q who="UNK">it is the
					sense of the club that Mrs. Sanger’s program should be adopted</q>.”</p>
			<p>
				<q who="CPD">Dr. Thomas said</q> “<q who="THOJO">No!</q>” <q who="CPD">and banged
					his gavel</q>. </p>

			<head type="sub"> 85,000,000 Child Minds</head>

			<p>
				<q who="CPD"> Mrs. Sanger, in opening her lecture, said that, according to available
					statistics, 85,000,000 of the 105,000,000 people in the <place>United
						States</place> have the mentality of a fifteen-year-old child. There are
					45,000,000 feeble-minded persons in the country, she said, and the upper group
					capable of raising and properly caring for intelligent children numbers only
					30,000,000. </q>
			</p>

			<p>
				<q who="CPD">She argued that the feeble minded and those who compose the lower group
					should be compelled to practice birth control, and that in some cases an
					operation to prevent conception should be resorted to. </q>
			</p>

			<p> “<q who="UNK">Do you think that we have progressed far enough in the science of
					psychology so that the official body which would pass on who should have
					children and who should not, according to your theories, knows enough to say who
					is feeble minded and who is not?</q>”<q who="CPD"> a questioner asked</q>. </p>
			<p> “<q who="WITPE">How do you know that there are 45,000,000 feeble minded?</q>” <q
					who="CPD"><person reg="Witt, Peter">Peter Witt</person> shouted</q>. “<q
					who="WITPE">Is that the vote <person reg="Hoover, Herbert">Hoover</person> got
					in <place>North Carolina</place>?</q>”</p>
			<p> “I’m not sure there are 45,000,000 people in North Carolina,” <q who="CPD">Mrs.
					Sanger replied</q>,” However, all my figures are contained in a report made by
				Prof. <person reg="Myers, William Starr">William Starr Myers</person> of
					<org>Princeton University</org>. I think they’re correct, but if you have any
				fault to find with them, consult the professor.” </p>
			<p> “<q who="UNK">Do you think that the 85,000,000 you spoke of should submit to an
					operation?</q>” <q who="CPD">another questioner asked</q>. </p>
			<p>
				<q who="CPD">Mrs. Sanger said</q>, “No.”</p>
			<p> “Birth control,” <q who="CPD">Mrs. Sanger said,</q> “means that children come into
				the world from choice and not by chance. She described it as “the keynote of a new
				social and moral awakening.”</p>
			<p> “Population can be controlled either by increasing the death rate or decreasing the
				birth rate,” <q who="CPD">she said.</q> “In the past population has been controlled
				by the former means. Now, with progress in surgery and the exercise of humanitarian
				principles, the death rate is being decreased. Yet population must be
				controlled-that is a necessity recognized by all students. </p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub"> Economic Reasons</head>
			<p> “In the first place, there are economic reasons. Why should the 20,000,000 who are
				physically and mentally capable and who compose the upper group assume the burden of
				supporting the oftentimes mentally deficient offspring of the lower group? </p>
			<p> “If a mother is not physically fit to bear a child and the father is economically
				unable to support it, why should such a couple be permitted to have eight or ten
				children? Many of these children are death-doomed anyway. </p>
			<p> “In the lower group, there is no correlation between income and children. Thus, we
				have slums, ignorance, disease and child labor. We spend billions yearly to care for
				the poor families in the lower group. Why not get at the heart of things and spend a
				good deal less money wisely? </p>
			<p> “<name type="law" reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211">Federal law</name>,
				passed 53 years ago, prohibits use of the mails to disseminate information on birth
				control, but federal law does not interfere with the practices of animal breeding in
				which only the wholesome stock is permitted to increase. </p>
			<p> “On the other hand, federal law limits the number of aliens into the country. They
				must be physically and morally sound and must have a certain amount of capital so
				that they will not become public charges. </p>
			<p> “Why shouldn’t the same principles apply in the rearing of families?</p>
			<p> “We are working to disseminate knowledge to prevent families having children where
				they don’t want them--where the children might be mentally deficient or sub-normal
				or where there is no support for them. </p>
			<p> “We believe that children should not come except at spaces of two to three years and
				that the young wife between 18 and 22 should not have children until she has passed
				the adolescent stage. Also a young couple should have at least two years to adjust
				themselves to each other and establish a harmonious home.”</p>

			<p>
				<q who="CPD">Dissemination of knowledge, she said, would have no effect on morals. A
					man chooses his course of action no more wisely when he is in ignorance. </q>
			</p>

			<p>
				<q who="CPD">In reference to determining the feeble minded in a community, Dr.
					Thomas asked if Mrs. Sanger meant the <org reg="Cleveland City Council">City
						Council</org> should be the determining group. She said,</q> “no.”</p>
			<q who="CPD">
				<p> Another questioner asked if the practice of birth control in poor families might
					not result in “geniuses not being born” since statistics indicate that the sixth
					or eight child in many cases is a genius. </p>
			</q>
			<p> “<person reg="Caruso, Enrico">Caruso</person> was a genius--he had a freak throat, a
				really abnormal throat,” <q who="CPD">Mrs. Sanger replied.</q> “Anyway, are we going
				to develop geniuses in that way? How do we know how many geniuses we have in any
				community today who have never been developed because they haven’t the economic
				chance?”</p>
