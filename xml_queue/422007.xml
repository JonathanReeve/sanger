		<p>
			<q who="HSB">Birth control is the answer to war, according to Mrs. Margaret Sanger, the
				world's foremost exponent of planned parenthood.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HSB">Mrs. Sanger was in <place reg="Honolulu, HI">Honolulu</place> Thursday on
				the <name reg="S.S. President Cleveland" type="ship">President Cleveland.</name></q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HSB">She is on her way to <place>Japan</place> for the <org
					reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood, 5th">Fifth International
					Conference on Planned Parenthood</org> and Overpopulation.</q>
		</p>

		<p>"We've seen the three countries which are overpopulated--<place>Italy</place>, 
			<place>Germany</place>, and Japan," <q who="HSB">Mrs. Sanger said at an interview at the
					<org>Pacific Club</org>, where a luncheon was given for her by the <org>Watumull
					Foundation</org>.</q></p>
		<p>"They had to branch out to other countries and finally move on to war.</p>
		<p>"With the terrible lesson of war fresh in their minds, the peoples of these countries are
			now looking for something like birth control so they will not be urged into another
			war."</p>

		<p>
			<q who="HSB">Mrs. Sanger said that 22 countries from the East and the West will be
				represented in the planned parenthood conference in Japan.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"They are all interested in knowing what to do,"<q who="HSB"> she stated.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="HSB">Even Catholic countries like Italy are now receptive to the idea of birth
				control, according to Mrs. Sanger.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"In all the time that I have worked for birth control," <q who="HSB">she went on,</q>
			"the greatest opposition that I have met has come from the American Catholic groups in
				<place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>.</p>
		<p>"Even in Italy, there is now a group of brilliant scientists and professional people that
			is working to do away with the <person reg="Mussolini, Benito">Mussolini</person>
			laws.</p>
		<p>"They never had a law against birth control until Mussolini made one, and you know what
			Mussolini was."</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HSB">Mrs. Sanger emphatically asserted that she had never met with any hostility
				in her work to propagate birth control.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HSB">She said that birth control had been practiced "way back in
					old--<place>Egypt</place>" and in <place>France</place> during the days of
					<person reg="Bonaparte, Napoleon">Napoleon.</person></q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HSB">She expressed gratification at the success of the birth control program in
					<place>India</place>, although it has been introduced in that country only in
				the last few years.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"In India, we are doing it with moving pictures," <q who="HSB">she said.</q> "In the
			slums, we are doing what we can do with children, showing the disadvantages when the
			parents cannot support their children, and the difficulties to the family when children
			come too fast."</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HSB">The Japanese are not going to build birth control clinics, she said, but
				utilize their midwives to teach birth control to the people.</q>
		</p>
		<p>"In Japan, they have so many midwives and not enough doctors," <q who="HSB">she
				explained.</q></p>
		<p>"It will be the first country to use midwives to go into homes and teach the
			mothers."</p>
