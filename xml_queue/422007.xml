		<head>Planned Parenthood Held Answer to War Danger</head>
		<byline>By <person reg="Fruto, Ligaya">LIGAYA FRUTO</person></byline>
		<q who="HSB">
			<p>Birth control is the answer to war, according to <person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Mrs.
					Margaret Sanger,</person> the world's foremost exponent of <org
					reg="Planned Parenthood Federation of America">planned parenthood.</org></p>
			<p>Mrs. Sanger was in <place reg="Honolulu, HI">Honolulu</place> Thursday on the <name
					reg="S.S. President Cleveland" type="ship">President Cleveland.</name></p>
			<p>She is on her way to <place>Japan</place> for the <org
					reg="International Conference on Planned Parenthood and Overpopulation, Fifth"
					>Fifth International Conference on Planned Parenthood and
				Overpopulation.</org></p>
		</q>
		<p>"We've seen the three countries which are overpopulated-<place>Italy,</place>
			<place>Germany,</place> and Japan," <q who="HSB">Mrs. Sanger said at an interview at the
					<org>Pacific Club</org>, where a luncheon was given for her by the <org>Watumull
					Foundation.</org></q></p>
		<p>"They had to branch out to other countries and finally move on to war.</p>
		<p>"With the terrible lesson of war fresh in their minds, the peoples of these countries are
			now looking for something like birth control so they will not be urged into another
			war."</p>
		<q who="HSB">
			<p>MRS. SANGER said that 22 countries from the East and the West will be represented in
				the planned parenthood conference in Japan.</p>
		</q>
		<p>"They are all interested in knowing what to do," she stated.</p>
		<q who="HSB">
			<p>Even Catholic countries like Italy are now receptive to the idea of birth control,
				according to Mrs. Sanger.</p>
		</q>
		<p>"In all the time that I have worked for birth control," she went on, "the greatest
			opposition that I have met has come from the American Catholic groups in <place
				reg="New York, NY">New York.</place></p>
		<p>"Even in Italy, there is now a group of brilliant scientists and professional people that
			is working to do away with the <person reg="Mussolini, Benito">Mussolini</person>
			laws.</p>
		<p>"They never had a law against birth control until Mussolini made one, and you know what
			Mussolini was."</p>
		<q who="HSB">
			<p>Mrs. Sanger emphatically asserted that she had never met with any hostility in her
				work to propagate birth control.</p>
			<p>She said that birth control had been practiced "way back in old-<place>Egypt</place>"
				and in <place>France</place> during the days of <person reg="Bonaparte, Napoleon"
					>Napoleon.</person></p>
			<p>SHE EXPRESSED gratification at the success of the birth control program in
					<place>India,</place> although it has been introduced in that country only in
				the last few years.</p>
		</q>
		<p>"In India, we are doing it with moving pictures," she said. "In the slums, we are doing
			what we can do with children, showing the disadvantages when the parents cannot support
			their children, and the difficulties to the family when children come too fast."</p>
		<q who="HSB">
			<p>The Japanese are not going to build birth control clinics, she said, but utilize
				their midwives to teach birth control to the people.</p>
		</q>
		<p>"In Japan, they have so many midwives and not enough doctors," she explained.</p>
		<p>"It will be the first country to use midwives to go into homes and teach the
			mothers."</p>
