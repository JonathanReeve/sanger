		<head>MRS. SANGER, NEW YORK WOMAN IN SEATTLE TODAY, TELLS HER IDEAS ON BIRTH CONTROL</head>
		<p>"Birth control will make women bearers of a sacred race, instead of bearing machines," <q
				who="SS">declared Margaret H. Sanger, the noted writer and advocate of birth
				control, who is in <place reg="Seattle, WA">Seattle</place> Tuesday to deliver two
				lectures.</q></p>
		<p>
			<q who="SS">She will speak Tuesday night at Longshoremen's hall, in the Immigration
				building, on "Birth Control," and Wednesday night on "The Right of the Child Not to
				Be Born."</q>
		</p>
		<p>"Birth control,"<q who="SS">she declares,</q> "is not race suicide. It is a creed to make
			a strong and sturdy race <unclear resp="MSPP">and to prevent the propagation of the
				diseased."</unclear></p>
		<p>
			<q who="SS">Mrs. Sanger came into national prominence a short time ago, when she was
				arrested in <place reg="New York, NY">New York city</place> because of the theories
				of birth control which, she preached. Her case was dismissed, however. She had been
				in earlier life a nurse in New York city, and she declares:</q>
		</p>
		<p>"I have not only seen the suffering and misery of the unwanted child, but the death of
			women who were determined not to add one more burden to their already too heavy
			load."</p>
		<p>
			<q who="SS">It is the poor, who, unable to give their children their full enjoyment of
				life, should restrict the size of their families, says Mrs. Sanger.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="SS">At present only the rich do it.</q>
		</p>

		<p>"The question now is," <q who="SS">she says,</q> "what are we going to do about it? This
			is what all of us have been asking for years."</p>
		<p>"And I want to tell you what I want to do. It is this:"</p>
		<p>"I want to establish free and open clinics in every district in the <place>United
				States</place> where poverty is rampant, disease is spreading and poor, worn-out
			working women are overburdened with too many children."</p>
		<p>"Let us, as civilized beings, give to these women this help they so ardently call for and
			are so anxious to receive."</p>
		<p>"In <place>New Zealand</place> and in <place reg="Netherlands">Holland</place> such
			clinics have been established for over 20 years, and the results have been such as make
			one wonder why we in this country have not done the same."</p>
		<p>"The practice of birth control helps the woman as it also aids the child, helps both to
			develop toward a better and happier humanity."</p>
