		<p>
			<q who="HEIEJ">(UP)--Mrs. Margaret Sanger, famous crusader for birth control, told the
					<org>United Press</org> today the organization she heads would discontinue its
				attempt to change <org reg="United States Government">Federal </org>laws banning
				dissemination of birth control information or appliances.</q>
		</p>
		<p>“We shall close our <place reg="Washington, DC">Washington</place> lobby, which has been
			maintained for several years, about March 1,” <q who="HEIEJ">she said.</q> “We believe
			it no longer is necessary to attempt to change the law in view of the recent <org
				reg="United States Court of Appeals For the Second Circuit">Circuit Court of
				Appeals</org> decision which held birth control appliances and information may be
			sent through the mails or in interstate commerce.”</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HEIEJ">At the same time, Mrs. Sanger predicted, the number of birth control
				clinics in the <place>United States</place> would be doubled by the end of 1937 as
				result of the court ruling.</q>
		</p>
		<p> “There are now 320 clinics in this country,” <q who="HEIEJ">she said.</q> “I believe
			there will be double that number by the end of this year because it is no longer
			necessary to ‘bootleg’ information or appliances.”</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HEIEJ">The decision to which Mrs. Sanger referred was one which held that the
					<person reg="Comstock, Anthony">Comstock </person>Law of 1873, relating to
				dispatch of “obscene” materials or writings through the mails or in interstate
				commerce, did not apply to birth control information or appliances. The Court held
				such information or appliances could be interpreted as health measures.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HEIEJ"> The test case involved shipment of a quantity of birth control devices
				from <place>Japan</place> to a <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>
				<person reg="Stone, Hannah Mayer">woman physician</person>.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HEIEJ"> Mrs. Sanger said a newly-discovered, inexpensive contraceptive she
				announced last year still was under laboratory tests in New York.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HEIEJ">The contraceptive, based on rice or corn starch, was designed, she said,
				“for the masses who cannot afford the commercial contraceptives now available to
				those in better circumstances, and, as a result, are overburdened with children they
				cannot care for properly.” The material, she said, now is being used in
					<place>India</place> and <place>China</place>, but will not be released in this
				country for at least a year.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HEIEJ">Mrs. Sanger is spending the winter in an exclusive resort in <place
					reg="Chandler, AZ">Chandler, Ariz.</place> She said she would go to <place
					reg="El Paso, TX">El Paso, Tex.</place>, in about a week to open a new birth
				control clinic.</q>
		</p>
		<p>
			<q who="HEIEJ">She appeared before a <org reg="United States House of Representatives"
					>House</org> legislative committee late yesterday to speak in favor of a bill
				proposing to repeal <place>Arizona</place> law which forbids advertisements or
				contraceptives. </q>
