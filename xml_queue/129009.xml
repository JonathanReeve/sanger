			<emph rend="underline"> The Limitations of Eugenics</emph>
		</head>
		<p>Eugenics has been defined as "<q who="GALFR"> the study of agencies under social control
				that may improve or impair the racial qualities of future generations, either
				mentally or physically.</q>" While there is no inherent conflict between Socialism
			and Eugenics, the latter is, broadly, the antithesis of the former. In its propaganda,
			Socialism emphasizes the dysgenic effects of our industrial and economic system. It
			insists upon the necessity of satisfying material needs, upon sanitation, hygiene,
			education in order to effect the transformation of society. Very correctly the Socialist
			insists that healthy humanity is impossible without a radical improvement of the
			social–and therefore of the economic and industrial–environment. On the other hand, the
			Eugenist points out, heredity is the great determining factor in the lives of men and
			women. Eugenics is the attempt to solve the problem from the biological and evolutionary
			point of view. You may ring the changes possible on "Nurture" or environment, the
			Eugenist might say to the Socialist, but comparatively little can be effected until you
			control the biological and hereditary elements of the problem. Eugenics [thus aims to]
			crystallize the tendency to seek out the root of our trouble, to study humanity as a
			kinetic, dynamic, evolutionary organism, shifting and changing with the successive
			generations, rising and falling, cleansing itself of inherent defects, or sinking into
			degeneration and deterioration under adverse and dysgenic influences.</p>
		<p>The term "<q who="GALFR"> Eugenics</q>" was first used by Sir <person
				reg="Galton, Francis">Francis Galton</person> in his "<title type="book">Human
				Faculty</title>" in 1884, and was subsequently developed into a scientific method
			and into an educational effort. Galton's ideal was the rational breeding of human
			beings. The aim of Eugenics, as defined by its founder, is to bring as many influences
			as can be reasonably employed to cause the useful classes of the community to contribute
				<emph rend="underline"> more</emph> than their proportion to the next generation.
			Eugenics thus concerns itself with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a
			race; also with those that develop them to the utmost advantage. It was in short the
			attempt to bring reason and intelligence to bear upon <emph rend="underline">
				heredity</emph>. But Galton, in spite of the immense value of this approach and his
			great stimulation of criticism, was completely unable to formulate a definite and
			practical working program. He hoped at length to introduce Eugenics "<q who="GALFR">
				into the national conscience like a new religion. . . . I see no impossibility in
				Eugenics becoming a religious dogma among mankind, but its details must be worked
				out sedulously in the study. Over-zeal leading to hasty action would do harm, by
				holding out expectations of a new golden age, which will certainly be falsified and
				cause the science to be discredited. The first and main point is to secure the
				general intellectual acceptance of Eugenics as a hopeful and most important study.
				Then let its principles work into the heart of the nation, who will gradually give
				practical effect to them in ways that we may not wholly foresee.</q> "Galton. <title
				type="book">Essays in Eugenics</title>: p.43.</p>
		<p>Galton formulated a general law of inheritance which declared that an individual receives
			one-half of his inheritance from his two parents, one-fourth from his four grandparents,
			one-eighth from his great-grandparents, one-sixteenth from his sixteen
			great-great-grandparents, and so on by diminishing fractions to his primordial
			ancestors, the sum of all these fractions added together contributing to the whole of
			the inherited make up. The trouble with this generalization, from the more modern
			Mendelian point of view, is that it fails to define what "characters" one would get in
			the one half that came from one's parents, or the one-fourth from one's grandparents.
			The whole of our inheritance is not composed of these indefinitely made up fractional
			parts. We are interested rather in those more specific traits or characters, mental or
			physical, which, in the Mendelian view, are structural and functional units, making up a
			mosaic rather than a blend. The laws of heredity are concerned with the precise
			behaviour, during a series of generations, of these specific unit characters. This
			behavior, as the study of Genetics shows, may be determined, in lesser organisms, by
			experiment. Once determined, they are subject to prophecy.</p>
		<p>But the problem of human heredity is now seen to be infinitely more complex than imagined
			by Galton and his followers, and the optimistic hope of elevating Eugenics to the level
			of a religion is a futile one. Most of the Eugenists, including Professor <person
				reg="Pearson, Karl">Karl Pearson</person> and his colleagues of the <org
				reg="University of London, Eugenics Laboratory">Eugenics Laboratory of the
				University of London</org> and of the biometric laboratory in <org>University
				College</org>, have retained the age-old point of view of "nature vs. Nurture," and
			have attempted to show the predominating influence of Heredity <emph rend="underline">as
				opposed to</emph> Environment. This may be true; but demonstrated and repeated in
			investigation after investigation, it nevertheless remains fruitless and unprofitable
			from the practical point of view.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, we should not minimize the great outstanding service of Eugenics for
			critical and diagnostic investigations. It demonstrates, not in terms of glittering
			generalization, but in statistical studies, of investigations reduced to measurement and
			number, that uncontrolled fertility is universally correlated with disease, poverty,
			overcrowding and the transmission of heritable taints. Professor Pearson and his
			associates show us that <q who="PEAKA">if fertility be correlated with anti-social
				hereditary characters, a population will fairly degenerate</q>." This degeneration
			has already begun. Eugenists are right in pointing out the fact that medical surveys
			reveal the fact that two-thirds of our manhood of military age are physically too unfit
			to shoulder a rifle; that the feeble-minded, the syphilitic, the irresponsible and the
			defective breed unhindered; that women are driven into factories and shops on day shift
			and night shift, that children frail carriers of the torch of life, are put to work at
			an early age, that society at large is breeding an ever-increasing army of undersized,
			stunted and dehumanized slaves; that the vicious circle of mental and physical defect,
			delinquency, and beggary is encourage, by the unseeing and unthinking sentimentality of
			our age, to populate asylum, hospital and prison.</p>
		<p>All these things the Eugenist sees and points out with a courage and bravery entirely
			admirable. But when it comes to a constructive program of redemption, orthodox Eugenics
			can offer nothing more "constructive" than a renewed "cradle competition" between the
			"fit" and the "unfit." It sees that the most responsible and most intelligent members of
			society are the less fertile; that the feeble-minded are the most fertile. Herein lies
			the unbalance, the great biological menace to the future of civilization. Are we headed
			to biological destruction, toward the gradual but certain attack upon the stocks of
			intelligence and racial health by the sinister forces of the over-fecund and
			irresponsible hords of irresponsible and imbecility? This is not such a remote danger as
			the optimistic Eugenist might suppose. The mating of the moron with a person of sound
			stock may, as Dr. <person reg="Tredgold, A. F."> Tredgold</person> points out, gradually
			disseminate this trait far and wide until it undermines the vigor and efficiency of an
			entire nation and an entire race. This is no idle fancy. We must take it into account if
			we wish to escape the fate that has befallen so many civilizations in the past. "<q>It
				is indeed,</q>" states Dr. Tredgold,Eugenics Review. Vol. XIII. p.349. "<q
				who="TREAF"> more than likely that the presence of this impairment in a mitigated
				form is responsible for no little of the defective character, the diminution of
				mental and moral fibre......which are only too common at the present day.</q>" Such
			populations, this distinguished authority might have added, <emph rend="underline">form
				the veritable</emph> "cultures"not only for contagious physical diseases but of
			mental instability and irresponsibility also. They are susceptible, exploitable,
			hysterical, non-resistant to external suggestion. Devoid of stamina, such fold become
			mere units in a mob. "<q>The habit of crowd-making is daily becoming a more serious
				menace to civilization...</q>" writes <person reg="Martin, Everett Dean">Everett
				Dean Martin</person>, "<q who="MAREV"> Our society is becoming a veritable babble of
				gibbering crowds.</q>"Cf. The Behaviour of Crowds. By Everett Dean Martin. It would
			be only the incorrigible optimist who refused to see the integral relationship between
			this phenomenon and the indiscriminate breeding by which we recruit our large
			populations.</p>
		<p>The danger of recruiting our numbers from the most "fertile stocks" is further emphasized
			when we recall that in a democracy like that the United States every man and woman is
			permitted a vote in the government, and that it is the representatives of this grade of
			intelligence who may destroy our liberties and who may thus be the most far-reaching
			danger to the future of civilization. "<q who="IREAL">It is a pathogical worship of mere
				numbers,</q>" writes <person reg="Ireland, Alleyne">Alleyne Ireland</person>, "<q
				who="IREAL"> which has inspired all the efforts–the primary, the direct election of
				Senators, the initiate, the recall and the referendum–to cure the evils of mob rule
				by increasing the size of the mob and extending its powers</q>."Cf. <title
				type="book">Democracy and the Human Equation</title>. <org>E. P. Dutton &amp;
				Co.</org>, 1921.</p>
		<p>Equality of political power has thus been bestowed upon the lowest elements of our
			population. We must not be surprised, therefore, at the spectacle of political scandal
			and graft, of the notorious and so universally ridiculed low level of intelligence and
			the flagrant stupidity exhibited by our legislative bodies. The <title type="journal"
				>Congressional Record</title> mirrors our political imbecility.</p>
		<p>All of these dangers and menaces are acutely realized by the Eugenists; it is to them
			that we are most indebted for the proof that reckless spawning carries with it the seeds
			of destruction. But whereas the Galtonians reveal themselves as unflinching in their
			investigation and in their exhibition of fact, and diagnoses of symptoms, they do not on
			the other hand show such power in suggesting practical and feasible remedies.</p>
		<p>On its scientific side, Eugenics suggests the re-establishment of the balance between the
			fertility of the "fit" and the "unfit." The birth rate among the normal and healthier
			and finer stocks of humanity is to be increased, by awakening among the "fit" the
			dangers of a lessened birth rate in proportion to the reckless breeding among the
			"unfit." By education, by persuasion, by appeals to racial ethics and religious motives,
			it is the hope of the ardent Eugenist to increase the fertility of the "fit." Professor
			Pearson thinks that it is especially necessary to awaken the hardiest stocks to this
			duty. These stocks, he says, are to be found chiefly among the skilled artisan class,
			the intelligent working class. Here is a fine combination of health and hardy vigor, the
			sound body and the sound mind.</p>
		<p>Professor Pearson and his school of biometrics here ignore or at least fail to record one
			of those significant "correlations" which form the basis of his method. The publications
			of the Eugenics Laboratory all tend to show that a high rate of fertility is correlated
			with extreme poverty, recklessness, deficiency and delinquency; similarly that among the
			more intelligent this rate of fertility decreases. But the scientific Eugenists fail to
			recognise that this restraint of fecundity is due to a deliberate foresight and is a
			conscious method to elevate standards of living for the family and the children of the
			most responsible–and possibly the more selfish–sections of the community. The appeal to
			enter again into competitive child-bearing for the benefit of the nation or the race, or
			any other abstraction, will fall on deaf ears. Pearson has done invaluable work in
			pointing out the fallacies and the false conclusions of the ordinary statisticians. But
			when he attempts to show by the methods of biometrics that not only the first child but
			also the second are especially liable to suffer from transmissible pathological defects,
			such as insanity, criminality and tuberculosis, he fails to recognize that this tendency
			is counterbalanced by the high mortality rate among later children. If first and second
			children reveal a great percentage of heritable defect, it is because the last and later
			born children are less liable to survive the conditions produced by a large family.</p>
		<p>In passing, we should here recognize the difficulties presented by the idea of "fit" and
			"unfit." Who is to decide this question? The grosser, the more obvious, the undeniably
			feeble-minded should indeed not only be discouraged but prevented from propagating their
			kind. But among the writings of the representative Eugenists one cannot ignore the
			distinct middle-class bias that prevails. As that penetrating critic, <person
				reg="Browne, Francis Worseley Stella">F. W. Stella Browne,</person> has said in
			another connection, Population and Birth Control: A Symposium edited by Eden and Cedar
			Paul. P. 251. "<q who="BROFR"> The <org>Eugenics Education Society</org> has among its
				numbers many most open minded and truly progressive individuals; but the official
				policy it has pursued for years has been inspired by class-bias and sex-bias. The
				society laments with increasing vehemence the multiplication of the less fortunate
				classes at a more rapid rate than the possessors of leisure and opportunity. (I do
				not think it relevant here to discuss whether the innate superiority of endowment in
				the governing class really is so overwhelming as to justify the Eugenics Education
				Society's peculiar use of the terms 'fit' and 'unfit'.) Yet it has persistently
				refused to give any help toward extending the knowledge of contraceptives to the
				exploited classes. Similarly, though the <title type="journal">Eugenics
					Review</title>, the organ of the society, frequently laments the 'selfishness'
				of the refusal of maternity by healthy and educated women of the professional
				classes, I have yet to learn that it has made any official pronouncement on the
				English illegitimacy laws or any organized effort toward defending the unmarried
				mother.</q>"</p>
		<p>This peculiarly Victorian conservatism may be inherited from the founder of Eugenics
			himself. Galton declared that the "<q who="GALFR"> Bohemian</q>" element in the
			Anglo-Saxon race is destined to perish and "<q>the sooner it goes the happier for
				mankind</q>." The trouble with any effort of trying to divide humanity into the
			"fit" and the "unfit" is that we do not want, as<person reg="Wells, H. G."> H. G.
				Wells</person> recently pointed out,Cf. The Salvaging of Civilization. to breed for
			uniformity, but for variety. "<q who="WELHG"> We want statesmen and poets and musicians
				and philosophers and strong men and delicate men and brave men. The qualities of one
				would be the weaknesses of the other</q>." We want, most of all, genius.</p>
		<p>Prescription of the Galtonian type would have condemned many of the great geniuses of the
			world who were not only "Bohemian," but actually and pathologically abnormal–<person
				reg="Rousseau, Jean-Jacques">Rousseau</person>, <person reg="Dostoevsky, Fyodor">
				Dostoevsky</person>, <person reg="Frederic Francois"> Chopin</person>, <person
				reg="Poe, Edgar Allen"> Poe</person>, <person reg="Schumann, Robert">
				Schumann</person>, <person reg="Nietzsche, Freidrich"> Nietzsche</person>, <person
				reg="Comte, Auguste"> Comte</person>, <person reg="deMauppasant, Guy">Guy de
				Maupassant</person>– and how many others? But such considerations should not lead us
			into the error of concluding that such men were geniuses merely because they were
			pathological specimens, and that the only way to produce genius is to breed disease and
			defect. It only emphasizes the dangers of external standards of "fit" and "unfit." Of
			the relation of Birth Control to genius I shall speak later, since the criticism is
			often made that this practice might prevent the birth of men of genius. I merely wish to
			emphasize here the limitations of the current standards of Eugenics.</p>
		<p>These limitations are more strikingly shown in the type of so-called "eugenic"
			legislation passed or proposed by certain enthusiasts. Regulation, compulsion and
			prohibitions enacted and effected by political bodies, are the surest methods of driving
			the whole problem underground. As <person reg="Ellis, Havelock">Havelock Ellis</person>
			has pointed out, the absurdity and even hopelessness of effecting eugenic improvement by
			placing on the statute books prohibitions of certain classes of people to enter the
			legal bonds of matrimony reveals the weakness of those eugenists who minimize or
			undervalue the importance of environment as a determining factor. They affirm that
			heredity is everything and environment nothing, yet forget that it is precisely those
			who are most universally subject to bad environment who procreate most copiously, most
			recklessly and most disastrously. Such marriage laws are based for the most part on the
			infantile assumption that procreation is absolutely dependent upon the marriage
			ceremony, an assumption usually coupled with the complementary one that the only purpose
			of marriage is procreation. Yet it is a fact so obvious that it is hardly worth stating
			that the most fertile classes who indulge in the most dysgenic type of procreating–the
			feeble-minded–are almost totally unaffected by marriage laws and marriage
			ceremonies.</p>
		<p>As for the sterilization of criminals not merely must we know much more of heredity and
			genetics in general, but also acquire more certainty of the justice of our laws and the
			honesty of their administration before we can make rulings of fitness or unfitness
			merely upon the basis of a respect for law. On this point the eminent <person
				reg="Bateson, William">William Bateson</person> writes: <title type="book">Common
				Sense in Racial Problems</title>. By W. Bateson, M.A., F.R.S. "<q who="BATWI">
				Criminals are often feeble-minded, but as regards those that are not, the fact that
				a man is for the purposes of Society classed as a criminal tells me little as to his
				value, still less as to the possible value of his offspring. It is a fault inherent
				in criminal jurisprudence based on non-biological data that the law must needs taken
				the nature of the offences rather than that of the offenders as the basis of
				classification. A change in the right direction has begun, but the problem is
				difficult and progress will be very slow.... We all know of persons convicted
				perhaps even habitually, whom the world could ill spare. Therefore I hesitate to
				proscribe the criminal. Proscription... is a weapon with a very nasty recoil. Might
				not some with equal cogency proscribe army contractors and their accomplices the
				newspaper patriots? The crimes of the prison population are petty offences by
				comparison, and the significance we attach to them is a survival of other days.
				Felonies may be great events locally, but they do not induce catastrophes. The
				proclivities of the war-makers are infinitely more dangerous than those of the
				aberrant beings whom from time to time the law may dub as criminals. Consistent and
				portentous selfishness, combined with dulness of imagination are probably just as
				transmissible as want of self-control, though destitute of the amiable qualities not
				rarely associated with the genetic composition of persons of unstable mind</q>." In
			this connection we should note another type of "respectable" criminality noted by
			Havelock Ellis: "<q who="ELLHA"> If those persons who raise the cry of 'race suicide' in
				face of the decline of the birth-rate really had the knowledge and the intelligence
				to realize the manifold evils which they are invoking they would deserve to be
				treated as criminals</q>."</p>
		<p>Our debt to the science of Eugenics is great in that it directs our attention to the
			biological nature of humanity. Yet there is too great a tendency among the thinkers of
			this school to restrict their ideas of sex to its expression as a purely procreative
			function. Compulsory legislation which would make the attempt inevitably futile to
			prohibit one of the most benificent and necessary of human expressions, or regulate it
			into the channels of preconceived philosophies would reduce us to the unpleasant days
			predicted by the poet when "<q who="BLAWI">Priests in black gowns will be walking their
				rounds And binding with briars our joys and desires</q>."</p>
		<p>Eugenics is chiefly valuable in its negative aspects. It has been "negative Eugenics"
			that has studies the histories of such families as the <person reg="Jukes Family"
				>Jukes</person> and the <person reg="Kallikak Family">Kallikaks</person>, that has
			pointed out the network of imbecility and feeble-mindedness that has been sedulously
			cultivated through all strata of society. On its so-called positive or "constructive" it
			fails to arouse any permanent interest. "Constructive" Eugenics aims to arouse the
			enthusiasm or the interest of the majority of people in the welfare of the world fifteen
			or twenty generations in the future. On its negative side it shows us that we are paying
			for and even submitting to the dictates of an ever increasing, unceasingly spawning
			class of humans who never should have been born at all–that the wealth of individuals
			and of states are being diverted from the development and the progress of human
			expression and civilization.</p>
		<p>While it is necessary to point out the importance of "heredity" as a determining factor
			in human life, it is fatal to elevate it to the position of an absolute. Like
			environment, the concept of heredity derives its value and its meaning only in so far as
			it is embodied and made concrete in generations of living organisms. Environment and
			Heredity are not antagonistic. Our problem is not than of "Nature vs. Nurture", but
			rather of Nature x Nurture, of heredity <emph rend="underline"> multiplied by</emph>
			environment, if we may express it thus. The eugenist who overlooks the importance of
			environment as a determining factor in human life is as short-sighted as the Socialist
			who neglects the biological nature of man. We cannot disentangle these two forces,
			except in theory. To the child in the womb, said <person reg="Butler, Samuel">Samuel
				Butler</person>, the mother is "<q who="BUTSA"> environment</q>." She is of course
			likewise "Heredity." The age-old discussion of "Nature vs. Nurture" has been threshed
			out time after time, usually fruitlessly because of a failure to recognise the
			indivisibility of these biological factors. The opposition or antagonism between them is
			an artificial and academic one, having no basis in the living organism.</p>
		<p>We cannot neglect the factor of social environment. We cannot neglect that of
			heredity–the importance of being well-born. The Socialist–particularly the
			Marxian–emphasizes one of these factors and neglects the other. The Eugenist, on the
			other hand, emphasizes heredity and neglects environment. Eugenics, therefore, due to
			this inherent limitation, this fragmentary program, remains on its positive side,
			diffuse, vague, abstract, academic and theoretical. On its practical side, its
			"negative" side, it must resort to compulsory and restrictive legislation, which, as
			events prove, is ineffective and ineffectual.</p>
		<p>The great principle of Birth Control, it may now be seen, offers the means whereby the
			individual may adapt himself to and control the forces of environment and heredity.
			Entirely apart from its Malthusian aspect or that of the population question, Birth
			Control must be recognized, as the Neo-Malthusians pointed out long ago, not "<q
				who="UNK"> merely as the key of the social position</q>," and the only possible and
			practical method of human generation, but as the very pivot of civilization. Birth
			Control, which has been criticized as negative and destructive, is really the greatest
			and most truly eugenic method, and its adoption as part of the program of Eugenics would
			immediately give a concrete and realistic power to that science. As a matter of fact,
			Birth Control has been accepted by the most clear thinking and far seeing of the
			Eugenists themselves as the most constructive and necessary of the methods of racial
			health. Among these are Dean <person reg="Inge, William Ralph"> W. R. Inge</person>,
			Professor <person reg="Thomson, J. Arthur">J. Arthur Thomson</person>, Mr. Havelock
			Ellis, Professor William Bateson, Dr. <person reg="Millard, Killick">Killick Millard
			</person>and . . . . . .</p>
		<p>We are now, I hope, in a position to understand the constructive and creative aspects of
			the philosophy and practice of Birth Control. It has been condemned as dysgenic,
			destructive of civilization, as the weapon of selfish unthinking pleasure-seeking,
			immoral and obscene. But in the following chapters, I hope to show that Birth Control is
			really an educational power, an ethical necessity in awakening racial responsibility and
			individual intelligence; that its effect is to arouse interest in children and to
			intensify their value; that it points to a re-direction of woman's power and energies;
			that it allies itself with the scientific point of view; and creates a set of values
			which operates to release new energies for human expression and the advance of a true
			civilization.</p>
