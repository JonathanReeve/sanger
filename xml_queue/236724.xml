		<head><title type="book">My Gandhi</title> by <person reg="Holmes, John Haynes">J. H.
				Holmes</person></head>
		<p>The interesting story of <add>Mr. Holmes</add> meeting <person reg="Gandhi, Mohandas K."
				>Gandhi</person> is not only delightful in its details but gives one such a vivid
			picture of Mr. Holmes--No one could possibly believe, that one who has met over the
			years thousands &amp; thousands of people from all stations &amp; from all nations
			classes &amp; casts confessed to have “missed the excitement of meeting great
			personalities because of my reluctance to grasp &amp; seize for my own satisfaction some
			portion of their meager stores of time &amp; strength.”</p>
		<p> All through the book is this same humility of a great Soul--(as J H H certainly is) not
			only could he not venture or trespass on the time of Gandhi in person but was reluctant
			to take his time in reading his letters. I agree with Mr. Holmes in describing
			Gandhi--not as a King with the material personally &amp; pageantry of a King--“<q
				who="HOLJO">For it was the Spirit not the flesh which clothed this man in more than
				majesty</q>” How splendid that the author met some of Gandhis dearest friends
				<person reg="Slade, Madeleine (Mirabehn)">Mirabehn Slade</person>, <person
				reg="Housman, Laurence">Laurence Housman</person>
			<person reg="Naidu, Sarojini">Sarojini Naidu</person>, and others. <person
				reg="Nehru, Jawaharlal">Nehru</person> Splendid too that thru his advice Gandhi did
			not come to <place reg="United States">America</place>.</p>
		<p> It was my good fortune to visit Gandhi for three days in 1936 at his ashram at <place
				reg="Wardha, India">Warda</place>. I am forever grateful to Mr. Holmes for sending a
			letter to the Mahatma before my arrival telling him what I was in India to do.</p>
		<p> Even tho Gandhi &amp; I did not see eye to eye on methods to control the birth rate, our
			ideas on nearly every other subject clicked.</p>
		<p> Just after reading <title type="book">My Gandhi</title>--someone kindly sent me <person
				reg="Sheean, James Vincent">Vincent Sheean</person>’s book on Gandhi.</p>
		<p> There too one finds a modesty &amp; humility in his approach--which it is good to know
			has feet by two outstanding Americans. </p>
