		<head>Birth Control.</head>
		<p> With the outbreak of the war in 1939, the continued drive of the
			totalitarian nations for increased population and the subjugation of
			the democracies where birth control programs had been in progress,
			not only did activities cease in large part in those countries, but
			with the rigid censorship no news on what was transpiring filtered
			through. </p>
		<p> The forced migration of millions of people in <place>Central
				Europe</place>, the starvation of millions more, the separation
			of families, with great bodies of troops either in movement or at
			the various fronts and away from home, all acted as a form of birth
			control. The malnutrition extending over large areas in Europe will
			affect fertility adversely during and after the European war. With
			these factors will come the fear of depopulation which manifested
			itself before the war. It is to be hoped that there will also follow
			increased recognition of the need for intelligent and honest efforts
			to solve the problems of population pressure, especially those
			dealing with population distribution in relation to national
			resources. Without such solution, a lasting peace can never be
			achieved for these causes are basic reasons for aggression. </p>
		<p> Emphasis in the <place>United States</place> birth control movement
			was, in 1940, on the need for expanding birth control services as a
			means of strengthening the physical and economic well-being of the
			nation as it planned for national defense. </p>
		<p><place>Australia</place>. - Birth control clinics continued to
			operate in Australia, but mothers in the low income group were given
			a maternity bonus of $20 on the birth of each child and in <place
				reg="New South Wales, Australia">New South Wales</place> a small
			weekly payment for each child after the first. </p>
		<p>
			<place>Cuba</place>. - In <place reg="Havana, Cuba">Havana</place>,
			films dealing with the "<title type="article">Technique of
				Contraception</title>" were widely presented to the medical
			profession and the leading medical associations. These is particular
			interest in the birth control program of its neighbouring island,
				<place>Puerto Rico</place>, where efforts to solve similar
			problems of overpopulation have been under way for several years. </p>
		<p><place>England</place>. - Activities of the <org>Family Planning
				association</org> continued in <place>Great Britain</place> up
			to the outbreak of the war. Birth control clinics still functioned.
			The clinic of <person reg="Stopes, Marie C.">Dr. Marie
				Stopes</person>, the first established in <place
				reg="London, England">London</place>, was bombed in an air raid
			in Oct. 1940 and partly demolished. </p>
		<p>
			<place>France</place>. - The new code which went into effect late in
			1939, not only provided new and drastic regulations against
			abortion, but prohibited the advertising of contraception. Because
			of censorship of everything published, including even a discussion
			of contraception, <title type="journal">La Grande Reforme</title>,
			the French Neo-Malthusian journal, edited by <person
				reg="Humbert, Eug&eacute;ne">Eugene Humbert</person>, suspended
			publication late in that year. </p>
		<p> Following the conquest of France, <person reg="Ybarnegaray, Jean"
				>Jean Ybarnegaray</person>, minister of youth in the <place
				reg="French State (Vichy)">Vichy government</place>, announced a
			new policy to stimulate the birth rate. The young women of France
			will be educated for one purpose only! <q who="YBAJE">“To return to
				their traditional purpose of life- being in their homes and
				living only to raise strong useful men.” </q>Fathers of families
			will be given preference over bachelors in both public and private
			employment and will be paid in proportion to the size of their
			families. </p>
		<p><place>Germany</place>. - Germany continued an uncompromising
			opposition to any form of birth control. In Dec. 1939, a new
			population policy was officially announced. All soldiers going to
			the front were expected to leave children or prospective children
			behind them. </p>
		<p> Since the outbreak of the war, censorship in Germany has resulted in
			a complete cessation of all statistical material on population. </p>
		<p><place reg="Netherlands">Holland. </place>- New birth control clinics
			were opened in <place reg="Amsterdam, Netherlands">Amsterdam</place>
			and <place reg="Enscede, Netherlands">Enschede</place>, both in
			industrial sections where many factory workers live. This progress
			took place prior to the invasion of Holland. After that, no news was
			received. </p>
		<p>
			<place>India</place>. - The <org reg="All-India Woman's Conference"
				>All-India Women’s conference</org>, which met in <place
				reg="Allahabad, India">Allahabad</place> in Jan. 1940, adopted a
			new resolution on family planning which urged that women medical
			officers in municipal and government hospitals, dispensaries and
			health centres advise married women on child spacing and that the
			technique of contraception be taught these officers. </p>
		<p> The <org reg="India National Planning Commission">National planning
				commission</org> appointed by the national congress passed a
			resolution that family planning and limitation of children were
			essentials in the interest of national economy and urged the state
			to adopt a policy encouraging the establishment of birth control
			clinics and other necessary measures to encourage the spread of
			cheap and safe methods of birth control. </p>
		<p>
			<place>Japan</place>. - Japan’s official pressure for a higher birth
			rate during the Sino-Japanese war resulted in an increase in the
			rate of infant mortality. Coupled with the demand for an increase in
			population, as a patriotic duty during the war, suppression of birth
			control clinics and of discussion of birth control continued. </p>
		<p><place>New Zealand</place>. - <org>The Sex Hygiene and Birth
				Regulation society of New Zealand</org> dissolved during 1940 to
			re-form as the <org reg="Family Planning Association of New Zealand"
				>Family Planning Association</org>, affiliated with the <org
				reg="Family Planning Association">British organization</org>. A
			deputation of workers from the association in conference with the
			ministry of health requested that contraceptive advice be given by
			physicians, when necessary, at state maternity hospitals. </p>
		<p> Puerto Rico. - With the legality of contraceptive advice, under
			medical direction, established in Puerto Rico by legal decision in
			1939, clinic services have been established under the supervision of
			the Puerto Rico board of health. The <org>Associacion pro Salud
				Maternal e Infantil de Puerto Rico</org>, under the medical
			direction of Dr. <person reg="Belaval, Joseph S.">J. S.
				Belaval</person>, continued its educational and research efforts
			to determine the type of contraceptive best adapted for use on the
			island. Public interest in the medical and public health aspects of
			birth control were stimulated by a visit from Mrs. Sanger in 1940
			and the medical films on contraception were being widely shown among
			scientific and medical groups. </p>
		<p>
			<place>Sweden</place>. - The new population measures instituted in
			Sweden which went into effect Jan. 1, 1938, based on the principle
			that voluntary parenthood and a positive population policy must be
			brought together, were in their second year. This policy emphasizes
			that only children welcome to their parents are wanted by the
			nation; but it also recognizes that certain social conditions must
			be rearranged so that more children can be welcomed. Birth control
			services were widely extended to reach all groups of society, but to
			reduce the economic motive for extreme family regulation, a series
			of measures, involving not cash premiums to parents but health and
			environmental services benefiting the children themselves, were put
			into effect. Hence skilled labourers and artisans in Swedish cities
			are having more children than the unskilled. It is to be hoped that
			the war will not destroy Sweden’s interesting and historic
			experiment. </p>
		<p> United States: Clinics. - The growth of birth control centres in the
			United States continued. On Nov. 1, 1940 these totalled 589, of
			which 106 were in hospitals, 178 in health departments and 305 in
			other quarters, largely extramural. Of these centres, 206 were
			supported wholly or in part by public funds. </p>
		<p> Human Fertility. - In Jan. 1940 the <title type="journal">Journal of
				Contraception</title>, published by the medical department of
			the <org reg="Birth Control Federation of America">Birth Control
				federation</org>, changed its name to <title type="journal"
				>Human Fertility</title>, as more truly expressing its contents. </p>
		<p> Field Work. - Representatives of the Birth Control Federation of
			America, Inc. co-operating with various health agencies, extended
			birth control services to underprivileged mothers in 11 states not
			yet ready to undertake state-wide programs under their health
			departments. The services were medically supervised and simple
			contraceptives were advised. </p>
		<p>U.S. Population Policies. - Wide attention was given to a report by
			the Population committee of the <org>National Economic and Social
				Planning association </org>which advocated “Provision for
			scientific information concerning appropriate methods of
			contraception for all potential parents is an essential measure for
			sound population policy.”</p>
		<p>Special Negro Project. - The federation, through a special grant of
			funds, established a division of Negro service, sponsored by a
				<org>National Advisory council</org> which included Negro
			leadership in all fields. Two special Demonstration projects were
			established, one in <place reg="Nashville, TN">Nashville,
				Tenn.</place> and one in <place reg="Berkeley County, SC"
				>Berkeley county, S.C</place>., to study the effects of
			medically directed contraception upon the health and welfare of the
			Negro populations of those sections. The Urban project in Nashville
			is under the direction of the <org
				reg="National Association of County and City Health Officials"
				>City Health officers</org> and the Rural project will be
			supervised by the chairman of the <org
				reg="South Carolina State Medical Association, Committee on Maternal Welfare"
				>Committee on Maternal Welfare of the South Carolina State
				Medical association.</org>
		</p>
		<p> Legal Action.- The <org reg="United States Federal Trade Commission"
				>Federal Trade commission</org> was active during 1940 against
			false claims for a number of commercial contraceptives. Cease and
			desist order were issued against some and suits instituted against
			others. Such government action was welcomed by the organized
			movement for birth control, as a step in regulation of the bootleg
			traffic in undependable contraceptives. </p>
		<p> Legal Decisions: <place>Connecticut</place>.- On March 21, 1940, the
				<org reg="Connecticut State Supreme Court of Errors">Supreme
				Court of Errors</org> of the State of Connecticut, by a vote of
			3 to 2, handed down a decision patterned on that in
				<place>Massachusetts </place>in 1938. The Connecticut decision
			upheld the existing statute and ruled that under it, it was illegal
			for a physician to prescribe, or a patient to use, contraceptives,
			even where definite medical indications existed. Connecticut is now
			one of the only two states in the Union where a doctor is forbidden
			to advise a patient on contraception and remains the only state
			where the use of contraceptives is illegal. </p>
		<p>
			<place>Iowa</place>.- A decision in a suit brought against a <person
				reg="Unidentified">druggist in Iowa</person>, in 1937, was
			handed down by the <org reg="Iowa State Supreme Court">supreme court
				of that state</org> in 1939. The druggist was accused of
			violating the law by distributing a pamphlet entitled <title
				type="pamphlet">“Birth Control.”</title> The court ruled him not
			guilty because the code of laws of the state specifically exempted
			medical schools, physicians and druggists from the provisions of the
			act governing distribution of contraceptive literature or materials. </p>
		<p> Massachusetts. - While previous court decisions declared it illegal
			for a physician to give contraceptive information under any
			conditions, the decision of the Massachusetts supreme court, Sept.
			17, 1940 by a vote of 3 to 1, reversed a former ruling and declared
			a pharmacist not guilty in selling certain articles for the
			prevention of conception because there was no proof they were to be
			used for the prevention of conception. This decision added to the
			existing legal confusion in Massachusetts, making it possible for
			bootleg traffic in questionable contraceptives to flourish, while
			legitimate medical contraceptive service remained outlawed. An
			Initiative Petition distributed by the <org
				reg="Massachusetts Mothers Health Council">Massachusetts Mothers
				Health council</org> to amend the statutes involved was filed
			with over 45,000 signatures, though only 20,000 were legally
			required. </p>
		<p> State Birth Control Federations. - There are now 32 organized state
			birth control organizations co-operating with the Birth Control
			federation. <person reg="Rose, Kenneth">Dr. Kenneth Rose</person>
			became executive vice-president of the federation in 1940 and
				<person reg="Morris, Woodbridge E.">Woodbridge E. Morris,
				M.D.</person>, former director of the division of <org
				reg="Delaware State Board of Health, Division of Maternal and Child Health"
				>Maternal and Child Health of the Delaware</org> state board of
			health became general medical director. </p>
