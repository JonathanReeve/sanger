			<p>The conditions in this city are somewhat better than in <place reg="Berlin, Germany">
					Berlin</place>. The streets are cleaner, the people less hungry looking; the
				cars not so crowded. But the working woman is reduced to the function of pack-horse.
				This morning I saw a young woman, who could not have been over twenty-five years of
				age carrying a huge basket strapped to her back; it horses, carrying produce from
				country towns to their homes or stores in the cities. They have become drudge
				animals in the fields. There are four women to one man taking the place of the truck
				and work horses. They nurse their babies beyond two years, to supply the milk which,
				in the absence of cows' milk, they hope will keep life in the children.</p>
			<p>It was a great pleasure to me to meet that splendid pioneer of the Woman's Movement
				in <place>Germany</place>--<person reg="Stritt, Marie">Marie Stritt</person>, a
				woman of refinement, culture, with a fine vigorous mind, speaking English with a
				care and better choice of words then most well educated Americans. Marie Stritt was
				a Pacifist in the war. Thousands of Pacifists were shot. She has been the pioneer in
				the Birth Control Movement in Germany, and organized the <org
					reg="International Neo-Malthusian Conference, 1912 (4th)">International Congress
					of the Malthusians</org> in Dresden in 1912. She is the editor of the foremost
				official paper for woman's suffrage here. She thinks it is not necessary to
				propagate the idea of Birth Control in Germany now; she says that the birth rate has
				fallen so rapidly in the last few years, that there is no need for spreading
				knowledge, or encouraging the idea. The organized movement is almost out of
				existence, but the knowledge is spreading everywhere.</p>
			<p>One of the most interesting achievements of Germany is Dr. <person
					reg="Hirschfeld, Magnus">Magnus Hirschfield's</person>
				<org>Institute of Sexual Science</org>. It is the only one of its kind in the world.
				Here is a beautiful dwelling, with palatial and spacious rooms, which at one time
				belonged to a member of the royal family. Since the Revolution it has been turned
				over to Dr. Hirschfield, who has converted it into a College where one may study all
				subjects relative to, or treating of the science of sex. These are various
				departments, each with specialists in charge, each department equipped with
				laboratories and X-rays.</p>
			<p>I am delighted to find Dr. Hirschfield so well informed on the subject of Birth
				Control. He is a personal friend of Dr. <person reg="Rutgers, Johannes"
					>Rutgers</person> of <place reg="Netherlands">Holland</place>, through whom he
				has been kept in touch with the work. There is also the possibility of the subject
				of Birth Control taking its place as a department in this Institute. Dr. Hirschfield
				was most cordial and hospitable, and kindly extended to me an invitation to address
				an audience if I would consent to speak in the Institute. As I was leaving Berlin in
				a few days, it was impossible to do so, and I greatly regret missing this splendid
				opportunity of getting the message before the physicians of Germany.</p>
			<p>I am now on my way to <place reg="Munich, Germany"> Munich</place> to get the facts
				of the birth strike so generally reported in <place>Europe</place>. Then, on to
					<place reg="Ravensburg, Germany"> Ravensburg</place> to investigate the clinical
				preventive which is said to be one hundred per cent, perfect in safety and
				harmlessness, and is also reported as having the government's official sanction.</p>
			<p>There are few people in Germany who will not acknowledge that country as
				overpopulated today. Everyone knows that, even though two million lives were
				sacrificed in the war, this deficiency has been made up by the million and a half
				inhabitants who were returned to Germany from <place reg="Alsace-Lorraine, France">
					Alsace-Lorraine</place>. Also on the Polish side there was at least the same
				number returned to the Fatherland, while hundreds of thousands of men and women were
				deported from <place>England</place>, <place>France</place> and
				<place>Italy</place>, and sent to the land of their birth. Thousands of them hate
				Germany--Germany is now a foreign and detested place to them.</p>
			<p>With all the facts of over-population before their eyes; with poverty, overcrowding,
				lack of food, mothers starving, children doomed to die in a few years, yet those in
				Germany elected to guide the destinies of the millions, will but reluctantly accept
				the idea of Brith Control for the masses.</p>
			<p>Of course they all accept and practice it themselves--always--but for the working
				women it is different. I talked to many of the foremost physicians here,
				gynecologists and baby specialists. Surely, I thought, these men, considering the
				kind of work they do, must have a better understanding of the actual needs of the
				country than others. But in this also, I was disappointed. The physicians are
				content that woman shall breed; no matter what she suffers, no matter what kind of
				child she may bring forth.</p>
			<p>I found not one physician, even of those in charge of all the appalling misery of
				Germany, who dared to say that Birth Control should be encouraged. I found several,
				however, who stood for women's right to have abortions--but for contraceptive
				advice, NO. "<q who="UNK"> It is knowledge that is too dangerous,</q>" said one very
				well known gynecologist to me. He agreed that something should be done during these
				years of chaos, and for the next five years to prevent more babies; but abortion
				seemed better to him than Birth Control knowledge. Why? Because knowledge to prevent
				conception involved woman's freedom. "<q who="UNK"> Once they know how to prevent,
					they will not go back to their old ways again,</q>" said the learned gentleman.
				That is the 'rub' in Germany.</p>
			<p>I went into one home where there were ten children living--the oldest was twelve
				years of age, and too young to work. The father a locksmith, was out of work; he had
				been out of work for several weeks. The family lived on one hundred marks which they
				received every eight days from the Unemployment Insurance. This was Saturday; the
				money was to come on Monday. These children were huddled together in two rooms, all
				living, cooking, sleeping there. They had had no breakfast; no dinner; there was not
				one crumb or morsel of food in that house. They were waiting for Monday. The father
				had gone to the woods to find mushrooms to keep them alive until their money came.
				Five of these children had been born since the war began!!!</p>
			<p>Many other families were in similar positions. They were all clean, but poverty and
				starvation stamped their faces horribly.</p>
			<p>The <org reg="Society of Friends (Quakers)">Quakers</org>' food
				stations--which by the way the children call "America"--are crowded to their fullest
				capacity. Only children who are ill enough, can come for food. Only mothers pregnant
				over seven months or who are nursing babies under four months, are allowed food. The
				spectacle of a nursing mother, or a pregnant mother, bringing her two or three wee
				children (not ill enough to be admitted) to share her food is too sad and horrible
				to dwell upon. The Quakers have a problem there, they can not put the children out,
				yet they want that mother to eat the food herself, for the benefit of the unborn
				child. </p>

			<dateline><place reg="Munich, Germany">Munich</place>, <date value="1920-09-11"> Sept.
					11, 1920</date>.</dateline>
			<p>There is a Birth Strike here. The common sense of the German mothers has caused it.
				It is not organized as one was given to believe, but certainly, the women are agreed
				that their condition is such that it is impossible for healthy children to be born
				or reared.</p>
			<p>In this city--the most lovely in Germany--there is more life and greater abandon than
				in the North. Munich is the <place reg="Paris, France"> Paris</place> of Germany.
				There is poverty and hunger here in plenty, but there is more food in the shops,
				more clothing and greater activity than in any of the other cities.</p>
			<p>This is the city where, during the Revolution, the <place reg="Soviet Union">Soviet
					Republic</place> flew its red flag from the housetops for over three weeks. I
				have met many of the leading people on both sides of the political arena. The
				Conservatives claim that the Communists were not able enough--that they were not
				capable of handling the situation. On the other hand the leaders of the Communists
				claim that they lost because they were not cruel enough. Their consideration, their
				ideals, their faith in human brotherly love, cost them their lives and their
				liberty. </p>
			<p>I talked to Mrs. <person reg="Muhsam, Kreszentia">Mushem</person>-- that <person
					reg="Arc, Joan of (St.)">Joan of Arc</person> who, together with her husband,
					<person reg="Muhsam, Erich">Erich Mushem</person> and <person
					reg="Landauer, Gustav">Landau</person>, inspired the masses to revolution.
				Landau is dead. He was kicked and clubbed to death by the <org>White Guard</org>.
				That gentle soul so believed in the good of man, that he talked and pleaded with the
				soldiers to be brothers, and urged them not to take life. They answered him in
				Prussian methods as they answered <person reg="Liebnecht, Karl">Karl
					Liebnecht</person> and <person reg="Luxemburg, Rosa"> Rosa Luxemburg</person>. Then,
				having finished with Landau they went to find Erich and Mrs. Mushem. Machine guns
				were used to wreck their apartment; not satisfied that they did not come out to
				escape, the <org reg="German Army">White Guard</org> stormed the place, breaking
				down doors, etc. Fortunately, both Erich Mushem and his wife had been previously
				arrested and were safely in jail. Erich Mushem is still in prison--his wife was
				released later.</p>
			<p>There is bitterness in the breasts of the "Reds" because they were tricked and fooled
				by their own faith in humanity. They say this has taught them a valuable lesson, and
				they shall not forget it.</p>
			<p>No wonder that the middle and upper classes will not give up their guns--they know
				this bitterness, and they know too that the class struggle is not settled, even tho
				the Red Flag is not flying over Munich. It is said that the upper and middle classes
				are prepared to make their escape at a moment's notice' they have peasants' boots
				and costumes ready and plans and money put aside for the emergency which all claim
				is bound to come.</p>
			<p>I talked to the <person reg="Unknown">Medical Chief of the Soviet</person>--a
				well-known practicing physician. He was tremendously interested in the subject of
				Birth Control. He told me that women in <place reg="Bavaria, Germany">
					Bavaria</place> are determined to stop having babies. He has given practical
				information to thousands, and would have established clinics all over Bavaria, had
				the Soviet Republic remained in power.</p>
			<p>I forgot to say, that in Berlin the <org reg="Freie Arbeiter Union Deutschland"
					>Syndicaliste</org> has physicians who give lectures on the practical side of
				birth control to the women of that organization.</p>
			<p>It was only when physicians were allied with such radical organizations as the
				Syndicaliste that they dared to come out for the practical side of Birth Control. I
				was glad to find these men far more sympathetic and enthusiastic for the use of
				contraceptive methods than they were for abortions. In this they differed from the
				conservative physicians, who fear to give woman knowledge which will free her.</p>
			<p>I visited hospitals in this city, and found them lacking in the simple and most
				ordinary articles of decency. No soap--no cod-liver oil, no rubber sheets to protect
				the beds--no linen to give clean bedding as required--and even the babies must be
				all day in wet napkins, because of the inadequate supply for the proper changes.
				This has given rise to skin trouble, and the poor little waifs are a sad, miserable
				lot. It would be a great kindness to let them die outright, I believe.</p>
			<p>Another dreadful thing, which gave me the nightmare for weeks, was to see the
				children's little mouths covered with horrible sores: and upon inquiring as to why
				this was so, and why so prevalent, I was told it came from the meat and milk of the
				cattle suffering from "mouth disease."</p>
			<p>The kind charitable folk may applaud the work which is keeping down the infant
				mortality rate in Germany, but I am not certain that their benevolence is so wise as
				it may seem. The old fashioned warrior who entered with sword and killed his victim
				outright has my respect after witnessing the "Peace" conditions of Germany.</p>
			<p>The <org reg="Unknown">Military Party</org> uses everything as "<q who="UNK">I told
					you so.</q>" It accuses the Socialists of bringing defeat upon the country.
				There is also the general feeling that had <place reg="United States">
					America</place> not entered the war, a juster peace would have been made--for
				then none would have been victors and none defeated. This they say would have meant
				a lasting peace.</p>
			<p>There seems to be no hatred towards Americans or the English, but only towards the
				French. All foreigners are made to pay a hundred per cent above the native price in
				hotels, and thus to prevent an influx of people who could easily live well at a
				small cost, owing to the difference in exchange.</p>
			<p>When I asked one physician what the doctors were doing to help tubercular women from
				becoming pregnant, he replied, "<q who="UNK">for those who can afford it we advise
					articles of contraception, but there is no use in advising women to purchase
					these articles who cannot buy bread, so such women are usually aborted</q>"
				(legally).</p>
			<p>I asked him if the medical profession, as a whole, was doing anything to prevent
				bringing into the world those children whose backs were so weak that they could not
				sit up straight, with bones too soft to hold the weight of the body, etc. His answer
				was "<q who="UNK"> they are doing their best to cope with conditions as they find
					them. It is not <emph rend="italics">their</emph> work to change
				conditions</q>."</p>
			<p>Fortunately there is a very large number of women all over Germany whom Nature has
				protected from pregnancy. The lack of fats and other foods necessary to the system,
				caused the suppression of the menses. These facts were forcibly brought forth by
				Prof. <person reg="Kraus, H. J.">H. J. Kraus</person>, Director of the <org
					reg="Charité-–Universit&auml;tsmedizin Berlin">Medical Clinique of Charities</org> in
				Berlin, in his address before the <org>Congress of the United Medical
					Societies</org>, December 18, 1918. Some of these women have become normal
				again, but thousands of them have been made sterile.</p>
			<p>The conditions of women and children are appalling. Thousands are suffering from
				tuberculosis, and are in need of foodstuffs which, unless they soon have them, are
				doomed to death before the winter begins.</p>
			<p>The same official barriers exist in Germany as exist in England and the United
				States. Those who are closely in touch with these suffering, overburdened, tortured
				women, hold from them the knowledge which would best help them. The working women
				here--like those in England--<emph rend="italics">want</emph> contraceptive advice.
				They ask their neighbors, their nurses, their friends, everywhere they seek.
				Anything they try. But those best qualified to help them hold off.</p>
			<p>Is this refusal to advise over-burdened women against pregnancy caused by
				selfishness, I am asked. Or is it a sub-conscious realization on the part of the
				medical profession that it will affect their economic position in the community? Or
				is it a deeply-rooted conviction that it is against the laws of <name type="deity"
					>God</name>?</p>
			<p>I asked these questions of a well-known man in London today, who answered, "<q
					who="UNK"> I think it is the <name type="deity">Devil</name></q>."</p>
