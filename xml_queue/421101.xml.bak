            <q who="TIMES"><p> Clinical birth control methods are approaching 100 per cent success;
                    but cheaper, easier and equally harmless means must be found to help the
                    millions to whom present methods are economically or geographically unavailable,

            <p> “The outstanding achievement of this bureau,” <q who="TIMES">Mrs. Sanger said</q>,
                “has been to inform, teach, instruct and give contraceptive advice to more than
                56,000 women who voluntarily appealed to us for this advice. The records of these
                women may truly be looked upon as a veritable human laboratory for research and
                correlations. </p>
            <p> “We have been fortunate in enlisting the cooperation of competent physicians and
                have amassed a wealth of incontrovertible evidence supporting the feasability and
                desirability of contraceptive practice. The evidence seems to be on our side, for in
                all the studies we have made we find, when our teachings are followed and adhered
                to, there is the record of 96.4 to 97 per cent success. </p>
            <p> “The birth-control movement has arrived at a stage in its development where it
                definitely can help that part of the population accessible to hospitals, doctors or
                in the health services where properly qualified doctors are available, but we must
                go further and supply the demand of women in the submerged sections who are
                clamoring for cheap and effective means to control the size of the family. </p>
            <p> “We must have methods that are cheaper, easier to apply and as harmless as those
                which we now use have proven to be. The scientist must come to our aid. We want his
                cooperation, his wisdom, his impersonal courage and vision.”</p>
